As AI technology advances, it will inevitably enter campuses and change traditional education models. When discussing the educational landscape of the next five years, we find that many pioneers in the AI field have already begun exploring how to apply these technologies in education. The efforts of these pioneers provide us with valuable experience and direction, but how these technologies will ultimately develop and be applied still requires the collective effort and responsibility of our generation. What the future educational landscape will look like, we hope to see a more intelligent and personalized learning environment, which is also the goal we strive for."

Many educators and students hope that AI can promote learning and growth. However, in reality, students have doubts about the practicality and interest of the courses. Some students believe that the course content does not meet their needs and even feel that learning is useless. This reflects that educational methods need to be more practical and targeted.\n\nStudents are the group with the most time and potential to learn new knowledge, but their motivation and engagement in learning are not necessarily high. How to make students understand and be motivated to participate in learning is a challenge. Course design should consider students' interests and actual needs and be able to stimulate their thinking and creativity.\n\nIn addition, interdisciplinary learning and collaboration are also considered important directions for future education. People from different professional backgrounds working together can inspire more innovation and valuable outcomes. Education should not be merely a one-way transmission of knowledge but a process of multi-party participation and mutual growth.\n\nIn this process, AI can play an important role. AI can not only provide personalized learning plans but also help students understand their learning status through assessments. However, the application of AI needs to be cautious to ensure that it truly enhances learning outcomes rather than becoming a mere formal tool.\n\nOverall, the combination of AI and education is full of potential but also faces challenges. Educators need to continuously explore and practice to find the most suitable teaching models and tools, allowing students to truly benefit from learning."

AI can assist teachers in grading assignments and exams, especially in more standardized tests, saving a significant amount of time. However, for content that requires higher subjective judgment, such as essays, AI's grading still relies on teachers' experience for final confirmation. This hybrid grading model, where the machine performs an initial assessment followed by a teacher's review, can reduce grading bias to some extent and ensure fairness and impartiality in grading.\n\nMoreover, the application of AI in educational assessments also faces some challenges. For instance, in large-scale exams or highly interactive tests, the application of AI is more difficult. However, in classroom quizzes or in-class tests, AI has more opportunities for application and can better assist teachers in the assessment process.\n\nIn the future, with technological advancements, AI is expected to play a more significant role in educational assessments, providing higher quality grading standards, reducing grading discrepancies among teachers, and more accurately reflecting students' learning outcomes. Nevertheless, this process still needs to consider individual differences among students and teachers' professional judgment to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the assessment results."

Taiwan has a rich resource of indigenous languages, and through large language models (LLM), these rare languages can be more easily preserved and utilized. Additionally, AI technology can help teachers reduce administrative burdens, provide personalized learning plans, and adjust according to students' learning progress and needs, thereby enhancing teaching effectiveness.\n\nThe application of AI in education also includes speech recognition and language learning, which can help students better master language skills. AI can also generate teaching materials, provide real-time learning feedback, and automatically adjust teaching content based on students' performance. Furthermore, AI technology can be used in psychological companion robots to provide emotional support to students, especially in resource-limited situations, reducing the workload of psychological counselors.\n\nIn the classroom, AI can help teachers design icebreaker games to enhance classroom interaction, automatically generate course outlines and related materials, and facilitate lesson preparation. AI technology can also assist teachers in differentiated instruction, providing personalized teaching plans based on students' different needs, thereby improving learning outcomes.\n\nOverall, the application of AI in education can not only improve teaching efficiency but also provide more diverse learning resources, helping students better master knowledge and skills. With continuous technological advancements, the prospects for AI applications in the field of education will become even broader."

As society's demand for versatile talents increases, the education system faces new challenges and opportunities. Versatile talents refer to individuals with multiple skills and interdisciplinary knowledge, who will be more competitive in the future job market. Many companies, such as NTT and APP, emphasize the need for more of these versatile talents to meet the rapidly changing market demands.\n\nHowever, in reality, educational resources are limited, and teachers face the dilemma of low salaries and high work pressure, making it difficult for them to cultivate students' diverse abilities. Additionally, many students consider future return on investment and work pressure when choosing a career, which also affects their motivation and direction in learning.\n\nThe introduction of AI technology is expected to change this situation. Through the application of AI, education can become more personalized and efficient, helping students better adapt to future job market demands. AI can not only enhance learning efficiency but also reduce the burden on teachers, giving them more time and energy to focus on teaching innovation.\n\nIn summary, the integration of AI and education will play an important role in the future, especially in cultivating versatile talents. The education system needs to adapt to this change and actively explore the application of AI technology to meet the future job market's demand for diverse skills and interdisciplinary knowledge."

Schools and educational institutions need to work together to implement AI on campuses and enhance AI education training for teachers.\n\nCurrently, many school systems and teachers are not fully prepared to face the challenges of AI, so more information and training are needed to improve their skills. Cross-disciplinary collaboration and data structuring are key to AI learning, which requires everyone's participation and behavior change, a willingness to try AI, and provide feedback.\n\nAdditionally, the education departments and schools hope to spread such discussions to involve more people. Students should start engaging with AI from the basic education stage to cultivate interest and skills in AI. This is not just about technical learning but also includes education on ethics and digital literacy, making students aware of the importance of protecting personal data and image rights.\n\nOverall, the application of AI in education requires joint efforts from multiple parties, from enhancing teacher training to changing students' learning methods, from technical training to ethical education. This is a comprehensive and ongoing process. Taiwan's education system needs to accelerate its pace to embrace the arrival of the AI era."

Many schools hope to increase training in this area so that teachers can more effectively use AI technology to improve teaching quality. However, it is a daunting task for teachers to ensure that students not only understand the course content but are also inspired and actively engaged.\n\nThe cultivation of AI teaching staff requires a dual approach, enhancing teachers' professional knowledge and developing their instructional design capabilities. This way, in future teaching scenarios, teachers will be able to flexibly use AI technology and guide students in deep learning.\n\nDuring the teaching process, each group or table needs clear guidance; otherwise, it is easy to reach an impasse. Teachers need to have the ability to design teaching strategies and collaborate with parents to provide more comprehensive educational plans. Additionally, planning and implementing remedial teaching is an indispensable part.\n\nOverall, the education field urgently needs talents with design thinking. This design not only refers to programming but also includes teaching strategies and curriculum design. Only in this way can the potential of AI technology be fully realized in future education, achieving more efficient and inspiring teaching."

Teachers use AI to process large amounts of data during evaluations, which not only increases efficiency but also makes the results more objective. However, this has also sparked some discussions, such as whether the evaluation process should be made more natural to avoid over-reliance on technology.\n\nIn the educational field, teachers need to record observations and conversations with students every semester. Although these records do not directly affect grades, they may influence teachers' impressions of students. Parents are also increasingly concerned about teachers' teaching conditions and may even review the curriculum to understand the content being taught.\n\nThe government invests a large amount of money annually in remedial teaching programs, attempting to narrow the academic gap between students. However, the latest PISA results show a polarization in the academic performance of Taiwanese students. While excellent students are getting better and weaker students are also making progress, the overall gap is still widening.\n\nIn summary, the application of AI in educational evaluation brings many conveniences and challenges. How to balance technology with a more humanized evaluation approach remains an important issue for future exploration."

      "topicShortDescription": "The development of AI technology has had a profound impact on the field of education, and this trend will become more evident in the next five years. Once AI technology enters campuses, it will transform traditional education models, providing a more intelligent and personalized learning environment. Many educators and students are looking forward to the application of AI in education, believing it can promote learning and growth. However, students have concerns about the practicality and interest level of the courses, reflecting the need for more practical and targeted educational methods.\n\nThe application of AI in education is extensive, including improving the efficiency and fairness of educational assessments, providing personalized learning plans, generating teaching materials, and offering real-time learning feedback. AI has shown great potential, especially in language learning and personalized learning plans. AI technology can also help teachers reduce administrative burdens, enhance teaching effectiveness, and play a role in psychological companionship and emotional support.\n\nIn medical education, the integration of AI technology and standardized training has become an important issue, helping students improve their learning outcomes. The application of AI technology can not only enhance learning efficiency but also reduce the burden on teachers, allowing them more time and energy to focus on teaching innovation. This is particularly important for cultivating dual-skilled talents with multidisciplinary knowledge.\n\nHowever, the application of AI in education also faces challenges. Teachers and students need to have the ability to judge the correctness of AI-generated results and require more information and training to improve their skills. Cross-disciplinary collaboration and data structuring are key to enabling AI learning, requiring everyone's participation and behavioral changes.\n\nOverall, the combination of AI and education is full of potential but also faces challenges. Educators need to continuously explore and practice to find the most suitable teaching models and tools, allowing students to truly benefit from learning. With continuous technological advancements, the application prospects of AI in the field of education will become broader, providing more diverse learning resources to help students better master knowledge and skills. Taiwan's education system needs to accelerate its pace to embrace the arrival of the AI era."

          "subtopicShortDescription": "AI in healthcare is playing an increasingly important role in modern medical systems, with a wide and diverse range of applications. Firstly, AI can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Through big data analysis and image recognition technology, AI can quickly and accurately assess medical conditions, provide diagnostic suggestions, and alert doctors to issues such as drug allergies or drug interactions. Additionally, AI can play a crucial role in emergency and urgent medical situations. For example, in the management of acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction, AI can help medical teams make swift decisions, improving patient survival rates.\n\nIn primary care and community outreach, the application of AI is also gradually becoming more widespread. Through telemedicine technology, AI can enable patients in remote areas to receive timely medical services, reducing the problem of uneven distribution of medical resources. AI can also assist nursing staff by reducing tedious paperwork, allowing them to focus on patient care. Moreover, the widespread adoption of AI technology needs to consider the acceptance of patients and their families. Through education and promotion, more people can understand and trust the application of AI in healthcare.\n\nHowever, the development of AI in healthcare also faces some challenges. Firstly, there are technical and legal issues. AI systems need to comply with local legal regulations and require significant financial investment. Secondly, the design of medical AI needs to consider the needs and habits of users; otherwise, it may not become widespread due to complexity or misalignment with actual needs. Additionally, cross-disciplinary collaboration is a key factor in promoting the development of medical AI. Medical teams need to work with technical experts to truly harness the potential of AI.\n\nIn summary, the application prospects of AI in healthcare are broad. From diagnosis and treatment to primary care and community outreach, AI can provide effective support. However, to truly integrate AI into the healthcare system, it is necessary to overcome challenges related to technology, law, and user acceptance. With continuous technological advancements and strengthened cross-disciplinary collaboration, the future healthcare environment will become more efficient and user-friendly with the inclusion of AI."

Many healthcare workers hope that AI can reduce the time spent on clinical work and tedious administrative tasks, such as medical record entry and medication distribution, allowing them to focus on core medical care tasks. The application of AI may also include speech-to-text technology to help doctors record cases more quickly and provide support in scanning and diagnosis, reducing the fatigue of continuous work. However, the design of AI must be cautious to ensure it truly simplifies processes rather than adding to the burden of frontline staff. Although AI has the potential to significantly reduce the working hours of healthcare personnel, some people are still concerned about the loss of job rights and the risk of being replaced. Therefore, the promotion of AI requires strong support from hospitals and schools, and healthcare workers need to feel the practical convenience and efficiency improvements it brings to truly achieve the simplification and ease of medical work."

Through discussions with senior practitioners in the medical field, we have learned about their expectations and challenges regarding AI. Medical personnel are often busy with tedious and repetitive tasks, which are not only inefficient but also affect their ability to focus on patient care. AI can help in this regard by detecting errors and standardizing processes, reducing the working hours of healthcare workers, improving diagnostic efficiency, and preventing misdiagnoses.\n\nHowever, the medical environment is overly specialized, leading to inconsistent treatment methods for patients across different departments, causing confusion for patients. The integration and standardization of AI can improve this issue, making medical services more patient-centered. Professionals from different fields and stages working together are expected to turn these visions into reality, improving the overall medical environment.\n\nAdditionally, AI can assist doctors in joint consultations, comparing previous cases to provide more evidence-based judgments. Such technological applications can not only enhance medical efficiency but also reduce human errors. However, AI cannot completely replace human thinking; it can only provide suggestions, and the final decisions still need to be made by medical professionals.\n\nIn promoting smart healthcare, communication and resource integration are crucial. The integration of systems between different hospitals and the opinions of primary care personnel need to be valued. Future healthcare should be human-centered, patient-centered, and emphasize the importance of preventive medicine. This requires a collective effort to achieve a more core and humane social healthcare system."

Firstly, translation errors and information confusion can lead to biases in medical decisions, posing potential threats to patient health. Additionally, legally obtaining patient data and performing de-identification are key to protecting patient privacy, but current laws and regulations still need further improvement to ensure the security and confidentiality of patient data during use.\n\nThe use of sensitive information such as patient medical history and medication history also needs to be clearly defined to avoid excessive access to this data, thereby reducing the risk of privacy breaches. The enhancement of databases and computing capabilities is fundamental to the development of medical AI, but this also requires higher data protection measures. The trust of patients and their families in the use of data is a crucial factor in promoting the widespread adoption of medical AI. Therefore, a comprehensive set of standard operating procedures (SOP) must be established to address situations where patients do not wish their data to appear in the system.\n\nIn summary, the application prospects of medical AI are broad, but it must be carried out under the premise of protecting patient privacy and legally obtaining data, so as to truly benefit patients and the healthcare system."

Many healthcare workers are currently overwhelmed by heavy administrative paperwork, preventing them from focusing on patient care. By introducing AI technology, these tedious tasks can be effectively replaced, allowing healthcare workers to concentrate on patient care. However, this requires the investment of national resources and interdepartmental coordination, as hospitals and other related institutions like fire departments operate independently, making coordination quite challenging.\n\nIn terms of regulations and governance, Taiwan's medical regulations are relatively stringent, with medical accidents potentially facing criminal penalties, which is unique globally. These stringent regulations place immense pressure on healthcare workers when treating patients. Therefore, it is necessary to establish new norms and insurance mechanisms to clearly define the responsibilities of healthcare workers and to compensate for accidents through insurance or relief systems, thereby reducing the legal risks for healthcare workers.\n\nAdditionally, promoting the application of medical AI requires patient consent and public trust. The government and relevant institutions should strengthen communication and participation, encouraging contributions from all parties to jointly develop a comprehensive governance framework to ensure that AI technology is applied in the medical field under legal and ethical premises. Only in this way can the true potential of medical AI be realized, benefiting both healthcare workers and patients."

This leads to difficulties in database integration when introducing intelligent or AI systems, and may even result in data gaps. Patient privacy is also a major challenge. Although patients have the right to take their medical records, there is currently no complete mechanism for patients to choose whether to upload their data to the system.\n\nCross-domain cooperation and information integration are key to solving these problems. Unified data input and continuously integrated databases can allow hospitals nationwide to share best practices, avoiding the development of redundant systems. The government should play an important role in this regard, providing reasonable policies and guidance to ensure the security and effectiveness of data sharing.\n\nIn addition, medical AI systems require strong backend support to effectively process and analyze big data. Through AI technology, doctors can extract similar cases from the database to assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, all of this is premised on data standardization and sharing; otherwise, AI systems will not be able to perform as expected.\n\nIn summary, medical data sharing is the cornerstone of promoting the development of medical AI. It requires comprehensive mechanisms, standardized processes, and cross-domain cooperation to truly achieve the goal of smart healthcare."

Many physicians worry that AI will replace their jobs, especially those professionals who rely on experience and intuition in the diagnosis and treatment process. However, surgeons believe they will not be completely replaced by AI in the short term, as surgery requires a high level of skill and real-time decision-making ability.\n\nSome physicians have a defensive attitude towards AI; they want to understand how to maintain their advantage in the competition with AI rather than being replaced. This mindset reflects the complex emotions within the medical community towards AI technology: a mix of anticipation and concern. Medical institutions should view AI as an auxiliary tool rather than pushing physicians to the forefront to bear all the risks and responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, the reliability of AI diagnostic results is also a matter of concern. Both physicians and patients need to have sufficient trust in AI results to truly apply them in clinical practice. Therefore, establishing a clear mechanism for responsibility attribution and a trust system is key to promoting the development of medical AI."

      "topicShortDescription": "Medical AI plays an increasingly important role in modern healthcare systems, with a wide and diverse range of applications. AI technology can assist doctors in making diagnostic and treatment decisions. Through big data analysis and image recognition technology, AI can quickly and accurately assess medical conditions, provide diagnostic suggestions, and alert doctors to issues such as drug allergies or drug interactions. In emergency and urgent medical situations, AI can also play a crucial role in improving patient survival rates.\n\nIn primary healthcare and community outreach, the application of AI is gradually becoming widespread. Through telemedicine technology, patients in remote areas can receive timely medical services, reducing the problem of uneven distribution of medical resources. AI can also help nursing staff reduce tedious paperwork, allowing them to focus on patient care. However, the widespread adoption of AI technology requires consideration of patient and family acceptance. Through education and promotion, more people can understand and trust the application of AI in healthcare.\n\nIn surgical applications, AI technology can enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment, assist medical staff in more precise triage, and reduce risks in high-error-rate surgeries, thereby increasing success rates. AI can also analyze a patient's condition before surgery, provide the best surgical plan and predict success rates, and act as an assistant during surgery to reduce errors. However, AI and robots must still follow standard operating procedures (SOP) to avoid affecting professional judgment.\n\nThe development of medical AI has also raised high expectations for reducing the workload of healthcare workers. AI can reduce the time spent on clinical work and tedious administrative tasks, allowing healthcare workers to focus on core medical care tasks. However, the design of AI must be careful to ensure it truly simplifies processes rather than adding to the burden of frontline staff. Promoting the application of AI requires strong support from hospitals and schools, and healthcare workers must feel the practical convenience and efficiency improvements it brings.\n\nThe development of medical AI also faces several challenges, including technical and legal issues, user needs and habits, and the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration. AI systems need to comply with local legal regulations and require significant financial investment. Medical teams need to collaborate with technical experts to fully realize the potential of AI.\n\nAdditionally, medical information and privacy issues are major challenges. Legally obtaining patient data and de-identifying it is key to protecting patient privacy. Current laws and regulations still need further improvement. The use of sensitive information such as patient medical history and medication history also needs clear definition to avoid excessive access to this data, thereby reducing the risk of privacy breaches.\n\nThe operation of medical AI relies on stable hardware equipment and energy supply. In the face of emergencies such as war or energy shortages, the operation of medical AI may be severely affected. Furthermore, medical data sharing is a critical issue. Many medical institutions have not yet established comprehensive data upload and sharing mechanisms and lack standardized operating procedures (SOP). Cross-domain collaboration and information integration are key to solving these problems.\n\nFinally, the attribution of responsibility for AI in healthcare has become an important issue. Current liability regulations typically attribute errors in the diagnostic and treatment process to doctors, which increases the pressure on doctors when facing AI technology. Establishing a clear responsibility attribution mechanism and trust system is key to promoting the development of medical AI.\n\nIn summary, the application prospects of medical AI are broad. From diagnosis and treatment to primary healthcare and community outreach, AI can provide effective support. However, to truly integrate AI into the healthcare system, it is necessary to overcome challenges in technology, law, and user acceptance. With continuous technological advancement and strengthened cross-disciplinary collaboration, the future healthcare environment will become more efficient and friendly with the inclusion of AI."

Even silence was seen as a form of participation. Participants believed that through such discussions and deliberation processes, more connections and understanding could be fostered, making everyone feel the importance of being noticed and understood.\n\nA low-income single mother, after participating in the discussion, felt for the first time that she could speak up for herself and that her words were recorded and valued, which made her feel unprecedented respect and recognition. This experience made participants realize that social participation not only brings personal growth but also promotes social harmony and progress.\n\nThe discussion also mentioned that the organizers hope such discussions can spread, allowing more people to participate and continue such exchanges in different settings, such as families, workplaces, or public workshops. Participants also began to exchange information and hoped to bring these experiences and insights back to share with more people, further promoting social progress.\n\nIn summary, the discussion highlighted the diversity and importance of social participation. Whether through speaking or silence, everyone can find their place in such processes and, through mutual sharing and understanding, promote the common progress of society."

As cold, unfeeling machines gradually replace human jobs, the warmth of interpersonal relationships seems to be fading as well. This phenomenon of technological indifference has led people to reflect on whether we should return to our original nature and intentions, valuing genuine connections between people.\n\nMoreover, the advancement of technology has also brought changes to social structures, particularly concerning those who are left behind. Providing systematic care for these individuals has become an important issue. If professional knowledge and technology are controlled solely by large corporations and governments, it could lead to collusion, further exacerbating social inequality. In such a scenario, social stability could also be threatened, leading to greater chaos.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the concept of the rule of law also needs to be re-examined. Especially in different cultural and linguistic contexts, the understanding and practice of the rule of law may vary. Discussions on these issues require more communication and participation, rather than having the fate of the majority decided by a few, which could otherwise lead to more social problems and dissatisfaction.\n\nIn summary, while the development of technology has brought many conveniences, it also requires us to re-examine the importance of human touch and social ethics, ensuring that in the pursuit of progress, we do not forget the warmth of interpersonal relationships and social fairness and justice."

These platforms, as a new medium, have changed the way people interact and communicate. In the past, people mainly relied on face-to-face communication or traditional media to obtain information and establish social relationships. However, with the rise of social media platforms, they have become an indispensable part of people's daily lives, whether it is sharing life moments, participating in public discussions, or building and maintaining social networks, these digital platforms are essential.\n\nSocial media platforms have not only changed the way individuals interact but also impacted the entire social culture. They provide an open space where people from different backgrounds and perspectives can freely communicate, promoting the integration and collision of diverse cultures. At the same time, these platforms have also become important drivers of social movements and public issues, with many social changes and cultural trends rapidly spreading and diffusing through these platforms.\n\nHowever, the popularization of social media platforms has also brought some challenges and problems. For example, information overload, the spread of fake news, and privacy issues pose new challenges to society and individuals. How to effectively address the negative impacts while enjoying the convenience and opportunities brought by these platforms has become an important issue that modern society needs to face.\n\nIn summary, as a new type of medium in modern society, social media platforms have profoundly influenced people's lifestyles and social culture. They are important tools for promoting social progress and cultural exchange, but they also present new challenges that need to be cautiously addressed."

      "topicShortDescription": "In modern society, the rapid development of media and digital technology has had a profound impact on society and culture. Media is not only a tool for information dissemination but also an important platform for cultural exchange and social observation. Through media innovation and development, we can gain a deeper understanding of different social phenomena and promote cultural diversity and inclusiveness. The widespread use of digital technology has brought about the integration and collision of diverse cultures. The background differences between digital natives and digital immigrants within teams inspire different perspectives and creativity, showcasing the power of multiculturalism.\n\nSocial participation is particularly important in modern society. Whether students, people from different professions, or age groups, meaningful exchanges can be conducted from diverse perspectives. This participation not only brings personal growth but also promotes social harmony and progress. In Taiwan's social and cultural context, social participation and the democratization process are especially important. The exchange of diverse opinions can stimulate more possibilities for future development and promote comprehensive social progress.\n\nCommunity and local participation have become important elements in promoting social cohesion. Many community activities are led by teachers, providing a platform for academic exchange and becoming important places for students to form emotional connections. These activities enhance interpersonal relationships and increase the sense of social participation. As community activities continue to improve in the future, it is expected that more people will get involved, promoting social harmony and development.\n\nHowever, the rapid development of technology has also raised concerns about the disappearance of humanization. As machines gradually replace human jobs, the warmth of interpersonal relationships seems to be gradually fading. This phenomenon of technological indifference has led people to reflect on whether we should value real connections between people. Additionally, the advancement of technology has brought changes to social structures, especially for those who are marginalized. Providing systematic care for these groups has become an important issue.\n\nThe emergence and popularization of social platforms have had a profound impact on society and culture, changing the way people interact and communicate, and promoting the integration and collision of diverse cultures. However, these platforms also bring challenges such as information overload, the spread of fake news, and privacy issues. How to effectively address the negative impacts while enjoying the convenience and opportunities these platforms bring has become an important issue that modern society needs to face.\n\nOverall, the development of media and digital technology has a profound impact on the observation of society and culture, deserving our continuous attention and discussion. Through the integration of diverse cultures, the promotion of social participation, and reflection on technological development, we can promote social harmony and progress, achieving a more inclusive and just society."

          "subtopicShortDescription": "In today's rapidly developing technological era, technical challenges have become a significant issue faced by various industries. Firstly, the architecture design of AI technology is crucial; without a comprehensive design, AI cannot truly perform its intended functions. Additionally, mindset shifts and technology acceptance are key factors in driving technological progress. Many startups fail to sustain themselves after developing new features due to rapid market changes, reflecting the high risk and uncertainty of technological development.\n\nReturn on investment is another important consideration. Technological development requires substantial capital investment, making it a major challenge to secure funding effectively. Taiwan also faces challenges in hardware equipment and network infrastructure, especially in meeting future demands for big data and 5G network speeds. Whether the existing capacity is sufficient to handle these demands still requires further evaluation.\n\nMoreover, the stability and reliability of AI technology are significant issues, particularly in emergency situations. For instance, if a machine operated by a firefighter is not stable enough, it could lead to serious consequences. Although blockchain technology offers traceability, its decentralized nature also brings new challenges.\n\nIn summary, technical challenges are not just about the technology itself but also involve mindset shifts, capital investment, infrastructure, and market changes. Integrating vast resources and finding a balance among these challenges is key to future technological development."

Different regions, such as Europe, may have different regulations for food safety and other fields due to varying local needs that require targeted solutions. For AI governance, the roles of specialized departments and laws are crucial. Laws must not only ensure cybersecurity but also guarantee the transparency and reliability of AI applications.\n\nPolicy formulation leads to corresponding regulations that clearly define the forms and timing of AI usage. For example, the European Union has strict prohibitions on AI applications related to psychological manipulation of children. The core of these regulations is how to handle AI governance to protect personal data privacy and security. Before establishing AI regulations, there were already many related regulations such as data governance and cybersecurity, which provide a foundation for AI governance.\n\nThe formulation of laws needs to consider multiple demands, including government policies, internal organizational norms, and individual requirements. The transparency and timeliness of laws are also key to ensuring that regulations can be updated and adapted promptly in a rapidly changing technological environment. In summary, the formulation of regulations and policies plays an indispensable role in AI governance, ensuring a balance between technological development and societal needs."

The government has the power to formulate and implement policies and can guide changes in social behavior through legislative and administrative means. However, the awareness and initiative of the people are also forces that cannot be ignored. Through civic participation and social movements, people can exert pressure on the government to take necessary reform measures.

With the rapid development of technology, especially the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), existing legal frameworks appear outdated and insufficient to address emerging challenges. The protection of patient personal data requires further refinement of current laws to ensure that the ownership of personal data is fully respected and safeguarded.\n\nIn the AI era, the formulation of regulations must not only ensure privacy and security but also possess flexibility and foresight to address various potential future scenarios. Standardization and integration are key to achieving this goal, and timely authorization and regulation can more effectively protect personal data rights.\n\nMoreover, how to use laws to govern AI and protect personal data rights has become a topic of joint discussion between the legal and technological communities. This involves not only technical issues but also the formation of social consensus and the impact on economic activities. The Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism of Ethereum provides a reference, demonstrating that in real life, laws and economic activities can achieve more efficient governance models through consensus mechanisms.\n\nOverall, data protection and privacy regulations need to be continuously updated and refined under the dual impetus of technology and law to meet the challenges of the digital age and safeguard everyone's personal data rights."

      "topicShortDescription": "When discussing regulations and policies, especially regarding the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the existing regulatory framework is considered relatively outdated and unable to fully meet the rapidly evolving technological demands. However, relevant discussions are still ongoing and not entirely lagging behind. To achieve legal and compliant commercial use of small models, mature regulations must support it. These regulations should be formulated by government policymakers, covering foundational work such as education and standardization, and clearly defining the usage scenarios of AI technology to ensure compliance in personal data protection and cybersecurity.\n\nDifferent regions, such as Europe, have different regulations for AI governance due to varying local needs. Specialized departments and laws play important roles in ensuring cybersecurity, transparency, and reliability. Policy formulation leads to corresponding regulations that clearly define the forms and timing of AI usage. For example, the EU has strict prohibitions on AI applications related to psychological manipulation of children. The formulation of laws needs to consider government policies, internal organizational regulations, and individual-level needs to ensure that regulations can be updated in a timely manner and adapt to the rapidly changing technological environment.\n\nIn Taiwan, AI regulations are still in the draft stage, lacking clear guidelines to direct and restrict AI usage. However, there are some related regulations such as data governance, cybersecurity, and digital markets, which can serve as the foundation for AI regulation formulation. The speed of legal regulation often lags behind technological development, making it necessary to ensure legality at every stage when implementing new technologies.\n\nRegulations and policies play a crucial role in protecting personal privacy and data rights. As technology advances, the text comprehension and reasoning abilities of robots continue to improve. However, if robots were to copy and transmit the acquired data verbatim to others, it could infringe on copyrights and harm the rights of original creators. Regulations should ensure that individuals' rights to be informed and to consent are respected during the data usage process, thereby effectively protecting personal privacy.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of promoting ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles, the formulation of policies and regulations becomes particularly important. While promoting infrastructure development, the state must ensure that it aligns with modern technology and environmental standards. Policy formulation should not only lead to corresponding regulations but also ensure sufficient funding support in areas such as technological investment and healthcare. Establishing a platform for all parties to share ideas and achieving sustainable development through policy guidance and regulation formulation is a current important issue.\n\nIn the process of discussing policies and international trends, the interaction and cooperation between the government and the people become key factors in driving policy changes and adapting to international trends. The government has the power to formulate and implement policies, but the awareness and actions of the people are also an indispensable force. Through civic participation and social movements, people can exert pressure on the government, prompting it to take necessary reform measures.\n\nOverall, the formulation of regulations and policies plays an indispensable role in AI governance, ensuring a balance between technological development and societal needs. With in-depth discussions and policy improvements, higher compliance standards are expected to be achieved in the future, ensuring that everyone's rights are not violated."

The accuracy of AI diagnostic systems relies on the collection and training of large amounts of data to generate results that patients can trust.\n\nDuring the data collection process, ensuring the professionalism and accuracy of the data is crucial, which requires the involvement of professionals. At the same time, the transparency and traceability of data sources are also key, allowing for effective auditing and verification. Web3 technology provides a new way of sourcing data that can be transparent and verifiable.\n\nAdditionally, language models (such as GPT) are very helpful in data collection, but they cannot make predictions, which still relies on training with large databases. To compensate for the lack of corpora, it is sometimes necessary to translate data into English, as English corpora are relatively larger.\n\nFinally, establishing an impartial third-party organization to manage and preserve personal data, with a default organization holding this data from birth, can ensure the security and fairness of the data. These measures and methods together form the foundation of modern data collection, providing solid support for various applications and research."

      "topicShortDescription": "In today's information and data-driven era, data acquisition and management have become the foundation for various applications and research. However, small countries or regions face the risk of data colonialism, making data acquisition a significant challenge. As the volume of data increases, capital also surges, enabling better utilization of data. The learning process itself is an important database involving a large amount of sensitive personal data, complicating data management and outsourcing issues.\n\nIn China, the development of open-source language models is rapid, but data filtering engines often align with specific ideologies, challenging the impartiality of data. In Taiwan, the lack of data, especially Traditional Chinese data, is a pain point for AI development. Local knowledge, although professionally valuable in fields like medicine and engineering, can often only be accurately identified by locals. Data cooperatives, as a mobilization strategy, attempt to solve data issues within this framework, promoting data sharing and collaboration.\n\nData collection has become the foundation for various applications and research. Whether for planning organizations or AI training, a large and diverse amount of data is needed for support. Legally acquiring data and conducting research and application is a key concern for many Principal Investigators (PIs). The accuracy of AI diagnostic systems relies on extensive data collection and training to generate results that patients can trust. Ensuring the professionalism and accuracy of data is crucial, requiring the involvement of professionals. At the same time, the transparency and traceability of data sources are also key, enabling effective auditing and verification.\n\nWeb3 technology provides a new way of sourcing data, which can be transparent and verifiable. Language models (such as GPT) are very helpful in data collection, but they cannot make predictions, which still rely on large databases for training. To compensate for the lack of corpora, data sometimes needs to be translated into English, as English corpora are relatively large.\n\nEstablishing an impartial third-party organization to manage and preserve personal data, with a default organization holding this data from birth, can ensure data security and impartiality. These measures and methods collectively form the foundation of modern data collection, providing solid support for various applications and research.\n\nThe development of generative AI technology gives us the opportunity to rediscover and utilize past research results, which not only enhances the value of data but also promotes innovation. By strengthening efforts in data digitization, we can more effectively manage and utilize these valuable information resources, thereby driving progress and development in various fields.\n\nData openness has become an important issue, promoting transparency and innovation. However, in practice, many people may not have the ability to use these open-source data. Even those familiar with platforms like GitHub may not be able to effectively utilize these resources. There are various ways to handle data; some choose to pledge or sell data outright to certain entities to gain economic benefits.\n\nInformation and data management and privacy protection have become important issues. Continuous data retraining is considered reasonable use, but downloading data may involve copyright issues, deterring many people. Web3 technology offers new solutions, such as citizen identity verification and data ownership management, allowing users to prove their identity and protect their privacy when participating in digital platforms. The development of blockchain technology meets social needs for decentralization, anti-censorship, and privacy protection, enabling individuals to better control and own their data.\n\nInformation security is key to ensuring that this information and data are not stolen or attacked. Effective information security measures can ensure the integrity and accuracy of data, thereby maintaining the stable operation of systems and user trust.\n\nThe integration of information and data plays a crucial role in modern society. The concept of standardized integration aims to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data, which is essential for establishing an efficient information system. Information from different fields needs to be unified and integrated into a database for easy access and analysis.\n\nWith the popularization of the internet and the development of Web 2.0, the importance of information organization has become increasingly prominent.

AI has the potential to enhance people's happiness and well-being, provide convenience in technological life, save time, and improve efficiency. However, it also raises concerns about technological indifference and the disappearance of humanization. As AI becomes more widespread, we face new technological and future challenges. These changes may eliminate some old ways but also bring new hopes and opportunities. People's reliance on AI is increasing, prompting us to reflect on our position and role in AI development. Overall, AI amplifies the impacts we face, but these issues are not caused by AI itself; rather, it magnifies existing challenges."

AI can also act as an assistant in daily life, helping to manage schedules and appointments, and can be promoted to grassroots communities. The application scope of AI is broad, including providing practical help on Facebook, creating presentations, selecting images, and explaining charts. AI can quickly capture important information and automatically reply to messages, enhancing tech-friendliness and enabling local governments and communities to use these tools more effectively. In summary, the development potential of AI is enormous, capable of enhancing the convenience of public services and personal life in many ways."

Although AI can perform reasoning and text organization, it still faces challenges in language translation and semantic understanding, especially since the proportion of traditional Chinese data is relatively low, limiting its application in Chinese environments. If AI design does not consider humanization, it may increase the burden on users, and in some cases, AI's judgments lack flexibility and cannot replace human professional judgment.\n\nIn practical applications, the stability and operating speed of AI systems are crucial, especially in interdepartmental communication and emergency response. However, over-reliance on AI may lead to the disappearance of humanization, thereby causing new problems. If the data sources of AI contain discriminatory content, it may perpetuate these biases, affecting its judgment results.\n\nOpen-source and customized AI models help promote AI technology, but quality is difficult to guarantee. Decentralized training and deployment require substantial resources, and further research is needed on issues such as ethics and human rights. The security of AI also needs to be ensured through debate and collective wisdom, but this may also lead to new problems, such as collusion between AIs.\n\nOverall, the application of AI needs to consider humanized design and cross-team collaboration, and attention should be paid to data democratization and technology acceptance during the promotion process. Only by achieving a balance in these aspects can AI truly realize its potential and bring positive impacts to society."

Those who know how to use AI may find more opportunities in this new era.\n\nSome people think that AI can reduce workload and improve efficiency, but they also worry that this will lead to fewer job opportunities and even unemployment. Particularly in creative jobs, such as screenwriting, AI-generated content might cause some workers to lose their jobs. However, those who know how to use AI tools can reduce their working hours and improve the quality of their work.\n\nMoreover, the development of AI has also prompted people to think about how to remain competitive in this transformation. Cultivating dual-skilled talents, who understand both professional knowledge and AI technology, has become an important direction. Such talents can not only adapt to changes in new technology but also play a greater role in the application of new technology.\n\nOverall, the impact of AI on careers is multifaceted, presenting both challenges and opportunities. People need to continuously learn and adapt to remain undefeated in this rapidly changing era."

As AI technology advances, many people worry that the coldness of technology will lead to the disappearance of humanization. This concern stems from the perceived temperature difference between technology and interpersonal interactions. While AI can improve efficiency and convenience, it may also cause people to lose opportunities for genuine interaction with others in their daily lives, thereby affecting the overall warmth of society. This phenomenon of technological coldness reminds us that while pursuing technological progress, we must also value and maintain human elements to ensure that technological development does not sacrifice the warmth and quality of interpersonal relationships."

      "topicShortDescription": "The development of AI technology has had a profound impact on human society, showing great potential and challenges in public services, personal life, and career development. AI can enhance people's happiness and well-being, provide convenience, save time, and improve efficiency. However, it also raises concerns about technological indifference and the disappearance of human touch, especially in daily life, where AI might cause people to lose opportunities for genuine interaction with others, affecting the overall warmth of society.\n\nIn the public sector, the application of AI technology is increasing, and many people expect AI to improve time management and efficiency. For example, public institutions like fire departments have begun designing and using AI systems. Although initial operations may be unstable, as technology advances, AI can accelerate processes and improve communication efficiency. AI can also act as an assistant in daily life, helping to manage schedules and appointments, and promoting convenience in public services at the community level.\n\nTaiwan is at a critical moment in the application and development of AI technology. Through phased technology releases and cross-disciplinary cooperation, Taiwan has the opportunity to secure a place in the global AI field. This requires joint efforts from different fields and stages, cultivating more dual-skilled talents, further expanding the space for AI applications, and laying a solid foundation for Taiwan's continuous development in the AI field.\n\nHowever, there is a significant gap between the ideal and practical applications of AI technology. AI still faces challenges in language translation and semantic understanding, especially since the proportion of traditional Chinese data is relatively low, limiting its application in Chinese environments. If AI design does not consider humanization, it may increase the burden on users, and in some cases, AI's judgments may lack flexibility, unable to replace human professional judgment.\n\nThe rapid development of AI technology has also led to deep reflections and concerns about the future of careers. Many people worry about being replaced by AI, especially in highly repetitive, low-tech jobs. However, those who know how to use AI can find more opportunities in this new era. Cultivating dual-skilled talents, who understand both professional knowledge and AI technology, has become an important direction.\n\nOverall, the development of AI technology has amplified the impacts we face, but these issues are not caused by AI itself; rather, it has magnified existing challenges. The application of AI needs to consider humanized design and cross-team collaboration, and attention must be paid to data democratization and technology acceptance during the promotion process. Only by achieving balance in these areas can AI truly realize its potential and bring positive impacts to society."

However, as technology becomes more widely applied in medicine, he has had to reassess this viewpoint.\n\nOn the other hand, the generation gap between digital immigrants and digital natives is also evident. A mother shared her interaction with her son; when her son wanted her to check certain content, she asked him to read it to her, but he lost interest as a result.

From the citation, it can be seen that participants gained rich learning and growth experiences through the activities. Even with only a few students participating, their enthusiasm and reluctance to leave the activities were palpable, and this emotional exchange was very comforting. After accepting the invitation and deciding to participate, participants gained new learning and life experiences through the actual participation process. Especially when a participant transitions from the role of a speaker to that of a listener, they can more deeply understand and resonate with the experiences and feelings of others. This role transition not only broadens the individual's perspective but also promotes deeper communication and understanding. Even when facing setbacks, participants can find resonance in their shared experiences and feelings, further strengthening the team's cohesion and spirit of cooperation. Overall, these personal experiences and feelings not only enrich individual lives but also have a positive impact on social interactions."

Faced with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, many people worry about being replaced, thus needing to think about how to enhance their own value to avoid being eliminated. This is not just a technical challenge but also involves a shift in attitudes and perceptions about work. In addition to improving professional skills, individuals also need to possess innovative thinking and the ability to adapt flexibly. On the other hand, the importance of money cannot be ignored in this process. Although financial issues may not be the primary consideration when discussing future work trends, economic pressure and financial stability remain real problems that everyone must face in actual life. Therefore, how to ensure economic stability while enhancing one's competitiveness has become an important issue that individuals need to balance in the AI era."

      "topicShortDescription": "In the modern society where AI technology is rapidly developing, the interaction between individuals and society has become increasingly complex. Many people feel deeply uneasy and self-doubtful during their encounters with AI, fearing replacement and trying to find inner balance in the process. This inner struggle reflects the complex feelings and challenges individuals face in the face of technological advancement, especially when the younger generation's views on money and the future differ from those of their predecessors, highlighting the sense of isolation and powerlessness individuals feel in society.\n\nThere are significant differences in the acceptance and adaptability to technology across generations. The digital divide between digital immigrants and digital natives is evident; the former often feel confused and uncomfortable when facing new technology, while the latter are accustomed to fast and intuitive digital operations. These experiences demonstrate the challenges and adaptation processes individuals face in the face of technological change, and also highlight the diversity and complexity of society in the digitalization process.\n\nPersonal data and autonomy have become important issues in the AI era. Whether we are adequately informed and give consent when our data is used is a concern for everyone. The ownership of personal data becomes more complex and important in the age of artificial intelligence, and we must ensure that this ownership is fully respected.\n\nIn the interaction between personal and social values, everyone shares their perspectives and experiences from their own identity roles. These discussions ultimately return to a core question: what can we do together to promote social progress? Diverse team members from different backgrounds can propose innovative solutions from various angles, fostering a more harmonious and progressive path.\n\nIndividuals play an important role in participating in various activities and discussions. Through discussions with others, individuals can gain different perspectives and suggestions, thereby adjusting their thoughts and actions. Participating in group activities not only allows for the sharing of information but also the learning of new knowledge and skills. This participation is not only personal growth but also a contribution to society.\n\nIn the AI era, how individuals maintain competitiveness in the workplace has become an important issue. Faced with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, many people fear being replaced, thus needing to enhance their value, possess innovative thinking, and be flexible and adaptable. At the same time, economic pressure and financial stability are real issues that everyone must face. Balancing the enhancement of competitiveness while ensuring economic stability has become an important topic that needs to be addressed.\n\nOverall, individuals experience complex emotions and challenges in the face of technological advancement and social change. These experiences not only enrich personal lives but also have a positive impact on social interactions."

These challenges will not end easily, so we need to continuously seek new solutions and development directions.\n\nIn this context, we should actively think about the next steps and propose more concrete suggestions. By brainstorming and listening to different people's ideas, we can inspire more innovation and development space. The results of each group discussion should be organized into specific action plans to more effectively address future challenges.\n\nAdditionally, integrating different opinions and directions to find commonalities can help us see the future development path more clearly. This is an ongoing process with no clear endpoint, but each step is a new beginning. We need to maintain an open mindset, continuously learn and adapt, to find our place in this rapidly changing era."

Although the pandemic brought many challenges, it also opened up new possibilities, prompting us to rethink the future we want. In particular, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a core technology that many anticipate, representing not only a technological breakthrough but also an opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration. Future development requires the joint efforts of people from different fields and stages to turn our imagination into reality.\n\nHowever, with the rapid development of technology, the future work environment and lifestyle will undergo significant changes, bringing many challenges, such as an increasing number of people potentially facing the dilemma of not being able to earn a living. Therefore, we need to continuously seek new solutions and development directions, and through brainstorming, listen to different people's ideas to inspire more innovation and development space. The results of each group discussion should be organized into concrete action plans to more effectively address future challenges.\n\nIn this workshop, participants actively engaged in discussions, sharing their views on future prospects and challenges. Each group was asked to identify the two most critical and important cards and discuss them under the guidance of the table leader. The organizers will compile the discussion content afterward and share it with everyone via email. Participants were very grateful for the opportunity to learn and exchange ideas on this platform and looked forward to more opportunities to hear from experts in the future.\n\nOverall, participants expressed high satisfaction and excitement about their experience in this workshop. They felt the richness of the event and the strong energy of the network, and were very happy and fortunate to participate in such an event. Many mentioned that this event reminded them of past experiences, especially some early memories of participating in hackathons. Participants found the way of discussing issues interesting, and with each round of warm-up, everyone's engagement increased.\n\nIn general, regarding the activities and feedback on future prospects and challenges, participants generally believed that these activities brought rich experiences and gains, providing them with a lot of valuable knowledge and insights. These activities not only provided a platform for learning and exchange but also made participants feel their own growth and progress. The feedback from participants was very positive, considering these experiences to be worth cherishing and reminiscing. The future is full of challenges and opportunities, and we need to face them actively, looking forward to more cooperation and innovation."

With the advancement of technology, the widespread application of AI technology has made the protection of personal data privacy more complex and crucial. Many people worry that if personal data privacy is not properly protected, situations like those in mainland China, where personal data is misused or monitored, may arise.\n\nTo ensure privacy and security, the formulation and enforcement of regulations are particularly important. Existing regulations have provided some degree of protection, but further improvement is needed. For example, regulations need to be updated in a timely manner to address the challenges brought by new technologies, especially concerning privacy, security, and trust in the AI era. Additionally, the protection of patient privacy is a significant issue that requires de-identification processes to prevent data misuse.\n\nIn terms of information security, preventing data theft and attacks is crucial. Both personal data and corporate data need strong security measures for protection. This includes technical safeguards as well as legal protections. When the Ministry of Education builds the learning history system, it is also necessary to ensure that it meets relevant information security and privacy notification requirements.\n\nIn practice, the use of personal data must obtain the full consent of the individuals concerned, and the process must be transparent and open, allowing data owners to understand the purpose and destination of their data. This is essential to build trust in AI technology and data usage.\n\nIn summary, privacy and security are important issues that cannot be ignored in modern society. They must be safeguarded through comprehensive regulations and technical means to protect individuals' basic rights while advancing technology."

Precision medicine emphasizes the accuracy of genetic sequences and formulates personalized treatment plans based on these genetic data. However, this also brings challenges to patient privacy protection. To ensure that patients' personal data are not misused, de-identification must be carried out, which means removing or hiding information that can identify individuals when using genetic data for research and treatment. Although genetic data itself has a high degree of personal identifiability, de-identification can still be achieved through technical means, thereby fully utilizing genetic data for precision medicine while protecting patient privacy.

          "subtopicShortDescription": "In today's digital age, privacy and security have become focal points of public concern, especially in the face of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Trust and acceptance have become significant challenges. Many people are puzzled about how to trust AI and worry about the reliability of AI outcomes. These concerns mainly stem from worries about the confidentiality of personal data, as data breaches could lead to severe consequences.\n\nPublic trust in AI is inconsistent; some people report very pleasant experiences using AI, while many others have concerns about its security. Particularly during various events, warnings about insufficient investment in cybersecurity are frequently heard, emphasizing that neglecting cybersecurity could lead to legal liabilities in the future.\n\nOverall, building trust in AI has become an important issue. This requires the joint efforts of technology developers, policymakers, and users to ensure that AI technology provides convenience while also safeguarding personal privacy and security. Only in this way can public acceptance of AI be enhanced, allowing AI to truly become a driving force for societal progress."

      "topicShortDescription": "In modern society, privacy and security have become important issues, especially in terms of personal data protection. With the advancement of technology, particularly the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the protection of personal data privacy has become more complex and crucial. Many people are concerned that if personal data privacy is not properly protected, it could lead to misuse or surveillance of personal information.\n\nTo ensure privacy and security, the formulation and enforcement of regulations are particularly important. Existing regulations have provided some degree of protection, but further improvement is needed, especially regarding privacy, security, and trust issues in the AI era. Regulations need to be updated in a timely manner to address the challenges brought by new technologies. Additionally, the privacy protection of patients is also an important issue, requiring de-identification processes to prevent data misuse.\n\nIn terms of information security, preventing data theft and attacks is key. Both personal data and corporate data need strong security measures for protection, including technical safeguards and legal protections. When the Ministry of Education builds the learning history system, whether it meets the relevant information security and privacy notification requirements is also a matter of concern.\n\nIn practice, the use of personal data must obtain the full consent of the parties involved, and the process must be transparent and open, allowing data owners to understand the purpose and destination of their data. This is essential to building trust in AI technology and data usage. Trust and security are core issues in the use of AI technology, and transparency and clear operational processes are important factors in enhancing trust.\n\nIn summary, privacy and security are important issues that cannot be ignored in modern society. They must be ensured through comprehensive regulations and technical means to protect individuals' basic rights while advancing technology. Only in this way can public acceptance of AI be improved, making AI a true driving force for social progress."

      "comment": "我要回應兩件事情 一個是那個 關於工作的部分 經濟的部分 這當然是一個 非常重要的部分 那我要推薦大家 看一本書叫做 那個不工作的世界 就是A World Without Work 那它裡面提到說 其實你去觀察過去 所有科技的進步 從工業革命到現在 大家都覺得人會被取代 但其實那個 工作時數下降 但是每個人的生產力 是往上的 那為什麼呢 因為大概它 舉中間 舉了三個可能的原因 一個是生產力效應 就是每個人 其實你可以創造的單位價值 每個小時的單位經濟價值 是提高的 比如說像我如果用這個 確認GPT 我舉另外一個例子好了 最近聽到一個朋友 他接了一個案子10萬塊 然後他用確認GPT 用哪個小時就寫出來了 那compile第一次沒有跑過 第二次他就改了一下 然後就跑過了 所以兩個小時做完10萬元 好 那生產力大幅提升 我講每單為什麼 每小時5萬塊 我覺得相當羨慕 那再來就是 當然它需要一定的技能 才能做到這件事 那個不是你來還來 它本身需要相當厲害 那第二個是 就是這個大餅效應 就是大餅效應是什麼呢 我現在有點忘記了 大餅效應就是說 在這個科技的進步中 從1700年到2000年 你去觀察世界上各個國家 他們的經濟規模都是幾倍的 幾千倍的成長 那美國的成長是超過1萬8千倍 從1700年到2000年之間 那另外一個變形的大餅效應 其實是在科技的進步當中 不只是這個經濟規模本身會成長 而且它的值會改變 會有轉型的狀況 所以比如說從農業社會 一直到服務業 到資訊企業的社會 它隨著這個變形的大餅效應 它的經濟也是翻倍的 所以我覺得對AI這件事 我覺得經濟還是會增加的 那像McKinsey在6月的一個報告是說 深層智慧AI會增加的 經濟價值是4.4兆美元 那現在問題來了 這4.4兆是怎麼分配的 誰會拿走 我覺得問題在這邊 你增加的價值誰拿走 當然你會用的會拿走 比如說我剛剛說那個 兩小時做完10萬塊 那他就拿走了那個紅利 那如果好萊塢的這個編劇和罷工 編劇罷工的情形也是一樣 其實它是一個在爭奪 那個增加的價值是在誰 主導權在誰手上 他們從5月罷工到10月初的結果是 其實電影公司是某種程度的妥協 就是他們有達成三個 媒體報導出來有達成大概三個協議 就是說不能用這個要求 就是把人類作家的這個成果 去用深層智慧AI編劇 那你也不能夠把這個深層智慧AI 就是AI做出來的材料素材 拿給人類作家 然後要求比較低的報酬去改編 那另外就是如果你的給的素材 裡面有用到 是用深層智慧AI生成的 那你必須要了解 那至少他們的做出了這三個協議 那你就可以看到說 其實你可以看到那個工具使用的紅利 紅利某程度是被移轉到這個編劇的 就是人類編劇的手上 那當然在很多狀況底下 你都沒有那麼大的談判的權利 可能就會變成是資本家或是老闆拿走 那我覺得這個都是值得持續觀察 那另外那個著作權的部分 確實是非常非常有趣 我就是覺得 台灣著作權有一個特別 我特別特別要講 是那個佳穎你也可以補充 台灣著作權法是有刑事責任的 所以我就一直在害怕一件事就是 我是那個年紀比較大 2000年我還記得什麼成大事件 就是學生下載MP3 然後檢調進去宿舍抓人 所以我就一直很擔心(拍拍隔壁肩 你什麼時候會被 哈哈 對 哈哈 所以我覺得我們現在應該不至於 希望啦 對 那如果這麼高的風險 那為什麼大家不去日本做就好了呢 就搬去日本做嘛 你這邊法律一直不改 日本又便宜又好住 好 我結束了"

      "comment": "大家好 就是我覺得有點很有趣的事情 就是不論是要訓練自己的AI 或是要訓練別人外國去做好的AI 最重要的都是資料 我們台灣在這個地方走的是 既是非常前面又非常落後 非常前面的一點就是說 大家有沒有印象 就是之前那個國科會 科技部後來變國科會了 2017年那個時候他們就開始辦AI比賽 科技大擂台 連續辦了三年 17 18 19 連續辦了四年 而且14年的時候 他還是號稱說要做 台語的自然語言對話的AI的比賽 然後每一年的那個首獎的預算 都是兩千萬的那種等級 然後一年就兩千萬的首獎 然後還有二獎是兩五百萬 然後每年首獎都從缺 然後他們也知道說就是要 政府也知道說要辦 要做這種東西需要很大量的資料 所以他其實每年也都有釋出資料 那就是號稱就是 每年我看他那個資料 其實都是就是幾千個小時 幾萬幾千個小時的對話資料 或是什麼自然語言資料 或是什麼一片的transcript的資料 那為什麼就到現在我們還在討論說 資料從哪裡來 就是大家會不會很好奇這件事情 那其實現在在網路上面 還是可以找到一點 當時這個活動所留下的遺跡 就是包含了那些資料集在 可能那個國科會跟開放資料集的網站上 你還是可以稍微找得到一點 就是大家 當然就是如果你真的去找 然後真的去把那個資料下載下來 然後去看一下裡面到底是什麼東西 你就知道那個數千個小時 其實就可能可以用的 就只剩下數百個小時 然後你要人工跳過 就剩下數十個小時之類的 對啊 我們其實走得非常的前面 2017年我們就知道要準備資料 要做自然語言對話AI 那時候連我們AI在哪裡都不知道 到了又走得非常的後面 因為到目前我們發現 2017到2020年 這四年的累積 到現在好像什麼都沒有剩下 我們現在手上最痛的還是 沒有可以用的資料 對啊 我比較擔心的是 如果假設這兩年 然後大家就是各種博項 各種研擬 各種討論 然後結束了之後 結論是我們政府的確需要出錢來做資料 到最後我們又再重新走一次 就是過去曾經走過 就是專家學者們曾經走過的路 然後就是因為政府有錢 他也不可能叫公務員自己來做資料 他一定又是要發包下去 發包下去之後 可能又會回到2017年 就是接任那個案子的 那些研究單位 他們可能又用過去曾經做過的方式來做 然後做出來的資料集又變成還是一個 不能用的資料集 那我們大概是要 希望能夠經過這些民主審議 或是這些共識的過程 可以讓這件事情不會再重演 然後最後真的可以變出一個 可以拿來訓練AI的資料 無論是要finetune 還是要重新開始教育的那種 好,這是分享的,謝謝 好,謝謝"

      "comment": "非常抱歉 我其實是遲到 可是聽了兩三個發言 我大概就可以記上來 2017年的科技大擂台 其實我們走更前面 這裡有現場還有人參與 其實我們有所謂的 數位典藏國家型計畫 那個確實 剛剛提到一個重點說 號稱有幾千小時的對話資料 然後再往下看 有些好像又重複 好像真正能用的 其實只有幾百個小時 或是幾十個小時 事實上我在幫忙 國科會下面的TAIDE計畫主持 Trustworthy AI Dialogue Engine 其實資料的取得 確實是我非常困擾 包括我也跟律師提過 我們三個禮拜前 還是上個月 那一個哈佛大學Lady Nesk 她來的時候 我們剛剛一起吃飯 她認為我們在做continuous retraining 這絕對是合理使用 那我就說 以後都用你的話去講 而且她還說 你就打個我的名號沒問題 但是最近又遇到一件事 當我們要把它download下來 這個動作 就不行 後面好像可以 所以其實這個 對我來講 這個邏輯是很奇怪的 就是說你把這個資料 somehow你拿到 放下去做continuous retraining OK 合理使用 可是去download這件事情 很多人不敢替我們做 因為他覺得說 這個某種程度是侵犯了著作權 所以這個我也 今天也特地來 也是希望 從這邊可以得到一些 大家的一些共識 那也剛好昨天 我特別去找那個 中研院李德才博士 因為他也參與了 數位典藏國家性計畫 那李院士說 他們好像有八大主則 八個分支 但是後來很多計畫的執行單位 他們都不願意把資料上傳 那甚至還有一個問題是 當他收集到這些資料 他說他沒有辦法 找到這data owner的授權 所以他就把他收在那邊 不上傳 那我就問他說 那我們有沒有可能 就某種程度 要求全部上傳 但是這個著作人 他可以有opt-out 當他看到 或是他對我造成損傷的時候 我要去claim我的利益的時候 他可以opt-out 我們不能說 卡在那邊因為找不到人 其實這個overhead確實很高 那我覺得說今天 當年在做數位典藏國家性計畫的時候 有些人叫他是做一個scanner 把所有的東西做scan 然後做OCR等等 甚至3D的去做scan 可是那時候的AI 跟現在的AI完全不一樣 我倒覺得說 把那些研究成果再挖出來重利用 其實在整個生成式AI 它會扮演很多價值 當然有些人覺得說 我現在做LLM 我要資料 可是事實上 那個數位典藏國家性計畫 也有很多圖 那些也非常重要 所以我認為說今天 這個資料這件事情 應該是大家要開始有一些共識 坦白講 當時我們在提TAIDE這個計畫 我認為說要有算力 要有資料 要有人才 那算力當然就找國網 那資料就覺得說 我公開授權 那我如果能爬到一些資料 甚至我們曾經讓openAI 的chatGPT 幫我們生成一大堆finetuning data 可是這些資料 根據那個openAI的服務條款 你也不能拿來training你的model 所以其實做下去 資料這一塊是困難重重 我想這一點是希望大家可以理解 因為包括我們確實也可以取得 那個科技大擂台的那些資料 可是弄一弄又剩一點點 那所以這一個資料是一件大的事情 那到這個階段 包括10月8號9號20號 CKIP的事件 因為我們中研院院長說 不要再講中研院事件 講CKIP 那我們為了寫這新聞稿 我花了七八個鐘頭寫新聞稿 那這整個事情其實也體現說 這個資料其實是大家重視的 那我覺得說 做了這麼久 我認為把資料整理 應該獨立出來一個大的計畫來做 即便是把過去數位典藏國家型計畫 的資料怎麼樣活化 怎麼樣可以合理使用 這些事情都是值得大家來做的 所以看一整個計畫 其實對於資料一踩進去 你才知道要選擇去嘗試 事實上是很有限制的 那我大概回憶一下 前面剛剛有提到說 到底我們要不要有屬於台灣價值的LLM 那也確實我們 我有學生跑來跟我說 他想要做原住民的LLM 那我說你為什麼要做這個 他說他是宗教的理由 他覺得有很多在原住民的教堂 教會裡面有一些資料 我確實也有回答過一些國際的學者 為什麼台灣要做LLM 那我就跟他開玩笑的講 因為他的問題是說 你把簡體轉繁體不就好了嗎 這exactly在10月6號以後 大家就知道不行這樣做 那我當時 我其實8月份給的答案 第一個我說 簡體中文跟繁體中文 不是樣態的不同 其實有一些翻譯 我那時候就跟他舉 potato 馬鈴薯他說土豆 他是peanut 那這還不太嚴重 那一個有些twinology 專業術語 這個其實是差蠻多的 那因為我都跟大家講說 我在大學教線性代數 我課堂上把中國來的留學生 我第一堂一定會告訴他 column在我們台灣叫行/欄 台灣的 Row 叫列 我們不叫列行 叫we are a soul we are a company and linearly independent 所以這個我相信不只這個例子 那其實你做了以後你才發現 語言這個東西 其實是有所謂的知識體系 有所謂核心價值 所以我是這樣的理由 我覺得說台灣是真的很需要做 那另外不管是 我們其實是用meta的Llama 2 那不管是Bloom我們也看過 Meta我們也看過 那當然OpenAI的ChatGPT也在那邊 其實這些所謂你可以看到的foundation model 中文的比例都非常低 而繁體中的比例又更低 那我很希望說我們真的好好把這些整理 我們這個模型做到一定程度 我們可以contribute 到這些國際大廠 當然有些人會concern是說 我們有這個資料 當把這個資料給人家的時候 台灣有沒有競爭力 可是你如果再想遠一點 事實上是我們整個價值 事實上是可以大家combine在一起的 所以我覺得這還才剛開始 那路還很遠 就真的是希望大家集思廣益 至少在著作權這上面 然後是不是讓我們在資料上 有更大的自由度 那我也可以跟各位分享 其實大家都在關注這個計畫 我們拿出來的模型到底可不可用 堪不堪用 那我們也知道說 當沒有這些著作權 這些種種限制 我們手頭上有一些資料 就完全不管他的全部放下去 確實比較厲害 所以我們還是要pick一個 自己看起來可以跟人家在一起 我們知道說 這個Large跟Business Model limitation在哪邊 但是我們也必須要有一個 合法合規的小模型可商用 要release出來 所以我們一直在講說 一個分階段的釋出 包括所謂的size 從7B、13B到70B 那同時我們也辦了 政府公部門的工作坊 10月30號 下禮拜17號 11月17號辦地方政府 然後未來還有一個Label Zone 我們要從To G 、To B 到 To C 那現在有一些我們合作的夥伴 今天我們有一個起點 拿到一些工程版 所以這個大概是TAIDE目前的狀況 也希望說大家一起來push 讓我們這個資料 叫一個完整的一個 繁體中文的語料庫給它誕生 好 謝謝"

      "comment": "就是我想分享的是那個 著作權法的部分 因為大家其實都有講到就是說 我的AI模型去讀了這麼多的 有著作權的資料 那這樣到底會不會侵權 那其實我從法院跟法律的角度來講 其實我們在看 有沒有著作權侵害的時候 就是兩個問題 第一個有沒有接觸 然後第二個 你有沒有實質近似 那像在這種讀取 所有資料的狀況之下 第一個其實它已經就是符合 法律上面會認為說 它就是已經抄襲了 所以你pass了這個階段之後 假設你是被告 你先做一個模型 你讀了這麼多資料 你最後剩下的抗辯就是合理使用 我們今天有很多人提到 就是fair use的概念 但是我可以跟各位分享 我們以前處理過一個案子 我們以前處理過一個案子是 它是一本文學童書 就是他去整理某個台灣的文學作家的 五六本書 然後有一個做電子資料庫 他就把整個scan 然後拿去賣電子資料庫這樣子 那各位覺得這樣有沒有侵權 那被告這樣行為有沒有合理使用 那我可以跟各位講就是說 在我們處理案件的過程裡面 有不同的法官 分別認為一個是合理使用 一個是什麼 不是合理使用 認為合理使用的那一位是說 反正你這些都是老舊的資料 沒有人看的資料 所以我把它變成電子資料庫 不是更多人看 更多人可以使用嗎 這樣就是合理使用 但是這個後來被推翻了 最後這個案子被認為不是合理使用 也就是侵權 因為其實你會影響到那個紙本書的銷售 所以在處理過那個案子之後 其實我本人對於說到底是不是合理使用 我也覺得很難判斷 所以你去問一個律師說 我現在做的事情到底是不是合理使用 他其實可能很難跟你保證 像剛剛有一位分享就是說 Lexic老師說 這個絕對是合理使用 但是問題是如果法院認為不是呢 可以跟Lexic老師求償 請他出來負責 請他出來負責嗎 所以是不是合理使用這件事情 只有法院說了算 所以我知道就是這個對大家來講 就是一個非常困擾的地方 就是你不去法院做一個訴訟 我甚至曾經幻想過說 有沒有人自願來確認不侵權的訴訟 或者是你就當可憐的騙子來試試看 你不試試看你沒有答案 像之前那個谷阿莫的案子有沒有 全台灣的這種IP的律師都在期待說 這到底是不是合理使用 期待法院給一個答案 那個只到地檢署 有沒有到地 有沒有要被起訴 而且有點忘記了 那就是辦其中 其中一方的律師是我的朋友 他就跟我說 跟你講去法院好了 法官就一直在問說 要不要和解 要不要和解 要不要和解 最後就是搓成了 因為法官不想寫判決 因為他覺得很難寫 就是你覺得合理 我們也覺得合理 那到底是不是合理使用 所以我覺得期待法院這一關 我覺得是很難的 因為它需要很多的時間 那可能不符合我們現在AI發展 非常的迅速 那所以大家剛剛也有想到說 那我們可不可以立法 如果立法的話 你就要去找智慧局 智慧財產局 那之前我有一次 私底下遇到那個局長 我就問他說 那你們有沒有要做這個AI指引 就是這樣到底是不是合理使用 大家期待他怎麼講 他就閃掉這個題目 開始去講別的問題 所以對他們來講 合理使用到底有沒有構成 這是法院的權責 你去看很多 就是有一些公司 他會發信問智慧局說 我現在做一個什麼什麼東西 這樣是不是合理使用 然後智慧局會給一個 簡短的法律的意見 但是他最後都會講說 這個涉及司法正義 你要去問法院 所以如果要找智慧局 希望他給一個 我覺得可能也不是那麼容易 我不知道他敢不敢講 這麼明確說 這樣是不是合理使用 因為這樣他會有越權的問題 那如果是要立法的話 你找智慧局對不對 智慧局上面還有經濟部 然後會館 著作權還有文化部 所以就是被利用到的著作 這些作家 藝術家 你覺得他會不會抗議 為什麼我的東西 要被AI執行 拿去做練習 所以就是如果要走 立法遊說這件事情的話 他會有很多的動作要做 然後也會像剛一三位講的 就是要由一個人來做 因為立法遊說其實很困難 因為我們最近 律師公會也在推一些法案 就發現說其實我們律師 也不太會立法遊說 我們會使用法律 但是我們不知道 要怎麼樣去讓立法委員說 好 我們來修改這個法律 其實這個很難喔 因為要先有一個行政部門 站在你這一邊 他說好 我們來規定說 這種資料看看 要像日本一樣是合理使用 他要來defend他的這個政策 然後他要去跟文化部說 這樣可以啦 我們為了大義的 我們要做AI模型 我們要跟世界競爭 他要去說服文化部 他要去說服經濟部 然後到立法院去之後 一讀二讀 還要找到對的人 對的立法委員 站在你這一邊 然後第三讀才會過完 所以就是我們現在在這邊講說 對 要有立法 可是那要有人去做 而且會很辛苦 因為我們律師公會 也在做這件事情 然後大家都是無償 然後就說立法怎麼會這麼困難 對 所以可能就是真的 要有人去做這件事情 對 那我剛剛 還有聽到一個就是說 讀 上傳資料 讀光讀資料這件事情 是不是OK 那我記得我之前 有看過Isabel的一個 那個影片 一個多小時 講得非常好 等一下 被自己說 好像是在1111人力銀行 對 她裡面有提到一個 那個日本的 深度學習生成協會的一個 一個guideline 她講什麼 因為日本其實 她對於這種讀資料 她認為是合理使用 所以她分成兩個階段來看 第一個階段是讀資料 她說讀資料這個沒問題 你可以讀 你可以把很多 有著作權的資料 去訓練你的AI工具 不過這是日本 日本說前階段這個就是 OK的 沒問題 但是你的東西 生成出來之後 就是你的生成結果 你還要再去看說 你有沒有侵害人家的肖像權 你有沒有侵害人家的著作權 你有沒有侵害人家的商標權 你要double check 所以目前 我覺得比較可行的狀況 就是說在利用生成式AI的那種 你要減少它的風險 其實就是 你生成出來之後 你還是要再去check 確實是會有很多的麻煩 我就補充到這裡 謝謝"

      "comment": "好 謝謝 我是聯發科創新基地的研究員 那因為 聯發科其實有在開發一個東西 那我想要呼應 就是一開始 你也有提到說 這個訓練的時候 這些書本雖然有被訓練進去 但是可能沒有辦法被察覺出來 所以就是也抓也抓不到 那我這裡想要額外提一點是說 我認為這個法令是 未來真的是需要朝 鬆的方向去走 因為除了抓不到以外 未來應該是會是連抓誰都不知道 那就是因為AGI的興起 那譬如說現在AI就是 假設你跟ChatBot說 你好笨 然後他就說我只是一個語言模型 我沒有情感 所以你罵我笨我也沒差這樣 可是以後當AGI起來的時候 就是你說你好笨 然後AI就自己 立了一個如何變強的一個plan 然後他就去執行這個plan 他就自己去上網抓資料 然後自己去爬那些 可能有著作權相關的文章下來 然後自己去訓練 就update一部 他只要做到update一部 他就已經達到 他自己強化自己的這個功能 所以等於說 他們完全沒有一個背後的人 可以去被定義說 拿來做這件事情 那就變成這個法規 就算有 也是會 等效上是沒有的這樣子 那所以 那現在還衍生其他問題 譬如說 AI還沒有看到 這一個文章 版權所有翻譯必究 那他怎麼會知道 這個文章是有版權的 那或是另外一個問題是說 AI如果能夠遵守 他看到說 這禁止抄襲上的什麼 然後他就把他 訓練到他的event裡面 所以他知道 他知道這個 他知道這個文章是有著作權的 這樣子就是 也沒有辦法去規範他說 為什麼不行這樣子做 然後 那我其實比較悲觀是認為說 著作權在這套系統完善之後 是會很難被執行的 因為譬如說 如果有 像有 我們也有看到 有些人會喜歡說 那請你已經有的 的創作風格去創作 一個一篇文章 然後呢 AI就知道有這樣的需求 所以他就不斷的去讀金庸 結果他發現讀一遍金庸 這個query打得更好 然後再讀一遍金庸 這個query又打得更好 所以他就讀了一千遍金庸 然後他就把金庸全部背出來 那這樣子就會 就是會變成說 這個著作權也很難被執行 那我會 我是不知道這怎麼解釋 但是我認為法規在一開始 授權設限 設置的時候 就不應該是以嚴格的方式進行 因為最後都還是得鬆綁"

這張卡片是要 因為做這些事情 就是 醫護人員 就要有一些誘因 不然你要讓他多學些事情的話 不能 你的意思是說這是增加還是說這是改變 所以必須給他誘因 機會還是挑戰吧 就是因為 就是因為如果之後要醫療環境變得比較智慧化的話 就是一定會有一些醫護人員不一定會想要學習, 那你一定要提供一些誘因讓他願意學習, 否則現在如果薪資差不多,他們可能會不想要學我們, 所以感覺還是需要調整薪水, 或者是提供一些錢上面的誘因,或是實際上的。 - 好的,這是一個想法。 - 這是一個對現況的分析,就是說,如果你想讓他們學習一些東西, 你需要誘因,是這個意思嗎? - 對。 - 所謂的相關法律對於 - 請問很重要的問題, - 這是一個很重要的問題, - 這是一個很重要的問題,這個呢?這個日子跟這個一樣嗎? 這個是我認為要做AI,就是做資訊化化,如果他沒有一個強大的後盾去發展這些東西,像是... 他很花錢,對,AI是很花錢,可以註明一下,因為這個放諸四海,所有個所有的事情這件事情的整理 到三點 你們到三點好了 對對對 討論你今晚的準時 掰掰很奇怪但現在在其他地方 說我的嗎? 對,我是本科系的對,我是本科系對,我們是本科系的對,所以你幫我 其實我們不是去讀歷史 對我們來說,這個歷史更多是做人員之間的功課 對,其實是要翻譯給人家說,為什麼要用這樣資訊系統 就是來找很麻煩 為什麼要用這麼複雜 那已經沒有 如果你這個功能還沒有 完上或是幫他減少時間 這確實麻煩的地方對對對對 可以理解 會組節奏不太一樣 有人動作快 有人動作慢 那已經動作比較快的我們稍等一下需要等待其他組員的動作。沒問題 是因為有修不不同的課所以剛好 同一個課 哦 然後這 到三點 三個對一個去廁所 好沒有問題主持人,您可以在視像中看到您的手機。 Böjningen är att det är en av.

OK,再來 這組資源前硬體軟體 軟體法規整合資料 5-6基雲端遠距醫療與設備 大數據分析與健保 這組的命名是 發展通信技術優化遠距醫療 今天需要補充嗎 沒有 那這組我們剛看過了 用法規 以保障AI時代的隱私安全與信任 這是確實DVD剛好沒命名的 再來這一組是 錢從哪裡來 科技投資健保要有錢 發展AI前強大的資源投資報酬率 然後他們命名叫做永續圓 大家覺得這樣清楚嗎 永續圓永續 源裡面的動詞是什麼 誰要給我 永續源 永續經營下去的錢 這樣比較清楚嗎 可以了 那自己錢從哪裡來 看你人在哪裡 - 好的,那你自己簽名,看你身邊的人在哪裡。- 哈哈。 - 看你的薪水。 - 哈哈。 - 好,這組三張圖片。 社會空間環境傳輸FDA, 我就會沒見識什麼AI系統穩定度 資安跟網路AI虛擬的圍堵力備案 好,再來原有流程開入責任歸屬 醫師和Segretary Debug流程負擔跟速度 專業判斷要思考不具彈性 所以這組給的命名是快速流程專業判斷要思考的不具含蓄所以這組給的命名是快速流程專業化 我不太看得懂快速流程專業化 因為它其實它的整體上的流程都是在講 今天流程的一個製作 專業化的話我是因為想說它debug今天流程的一個製作還有 專業化我畫畫是因為想說它debug就是它上面寫debug 然後還有寫那一個 看一下 它就是還有一個上面的流程的 那一個金屬化的部分 所以我才選擇說畫畫 那種專業化 然後快速化就是快筆下的 有給那個少年文化 大家覺得這樣可以嗎 有沒有人有不同的建議 會讓他更清楚的 可是暫時沒有就放著 我們就照這樣 然後最後一組編入教程 他們花了好多時間想編入教程他們花了好多時間想 編入教程 AI 教育訓練於是 俱進學習新的知識 KMU AI 師資提升 任何人公開資訊 AI 人才培訓 培育 程式可進性健保卡 APP 要更多雙棲人才的培養 AI 衛教對 AI 理解 這種卡片之別的命名是 AI 師資與養成教育 張凱雄 看起來要做的事情還不少這樣OK嗎 看起來要做的事情還不少大家想的層面 其實每一個課都可以是一件大事 這個是我們的回答 就是整理大家的想法 覺得我們需要面對我們想要的未來 我們需要做什麼跟怎麼做 然後我們會有機會跟挑戰 站正面牆上 好,深呼吸一下 我常常覺得我在台前台下 巴克風就是出功課給大家做 下一輪是最後一輪我想邀請大家做的是 我們桌上其實有利貼 我想要邀請每一個人 因為這個利貼等一下寫了 我希望你們把它留下來 就是要留給我們主辦單位做資料 就是請大家寫的兩個面向 一個是經過今天的討論 經過今天的討論 你聽了別人的想法 你分享你的想法 我們看到未來的可能性 也看到從現在要走到未來 中間還有很多路要走 姜莉姜-那因為你參加了今天這個討論 姜莉姜-然後我們一起以人為本 姜莉姜-以病人為中心去思考未來的智慧醫療的方式 姜莉姜-然後因為這跟每一個人你的WISP都不一樣 姜莉姜-那我要邀請你的一個部分是寫從你開始 姜莉姜開始或從你的組織 你覺得要邁向未來 你想下一步要讓智慧醫療更核心 更理想的話 你想要做什麼 從你開始 你可能是一個個人學生 你可能是一個部門主管 從你開始你可以做什麼 那這個歡迎你寫一張兩張三張 你有實踐想做的 未來的五年的實踐大師也歡迎 另外一面像是從外部 我們看到這些之後 你覺得因為今天其實 我們也是有政府單位在場 在訪我們資料整理完之後也是會有政府單位在場我們資料整理完之後 也是會給政府單位參考 也是會給 因為在座有很多是我們高一的夥伴 有機會也是會給這裡的決策者參考 所以從我之外 你希望外部 包括政府 包括你的組織 需要努力,需要做些什麼 也歡迎您寫下來 可以嗎? 寫兩種 我們現在放兩張大海報紙 請大家把它貼在不同的海報紙上 好,給大家幾分鐘的時間 你可以不數名但是不要說已經標準了,但是你可以有你的身份,我不管。現在是最好的許願時間,可以把希望政府做的事情全部寫下來,可以直接給政府觀察員。好 我們要上街抗議的時候"

      "comment": "那我的部分就會思考到有幾個面向 第一我在挑戰的部分 我會思考到我們台灣目前的所謂的硬體設備 還有一些網路的問題 那這個部分的架構 我們的能量可不可以去承載 未來整個大數據的一個 應該說更大量的5G的一些網速 或者是容量的一些問題 然後包含這個部分 會不會衝擊到我們大自然的一些狀況 因為畢竟耗用這一些的能量 其實聽說水資源其實是一個很重要的問題 尤其是我們中南部又比較容易吹水 或者是我們現在的大自然的一個 毒水量的一些狀況 也是也面臨到一些挑戰跟未知 不好預測的問題 這是我們要去思考 然後第二就是像剛剛老師 另外老師他提到所謂的閱讀能力判斷能力的部分,尤其是我們現在大家都是喜歡看這種短語音的部分,然後可能閱讀上的能力是不是有被削弱的問題,然後判斷上是不是越來越沒耐心,會不會我們更容易去傾向說,OK,AI跟我說1就1,2就2,我就順著它走,如果說這件事情政府有相關的法規來保障說這件事情 或者說已經把這個判斷能力的權利已經託付 有一大地的部分已經是承認 由其他的公司或第三代理者來幫我去分擔這個承擔風險的話 我會不會變成說我專業的能力其實我只是照著他走 只要不要很明顯的大錯誤 都乾脆就跟著他走 真十之八九 不會偏差太多 就還有保留的餘地 了解這樣子 那第三就是剛剛我們看到 那些生存圖片看起來 其實好像很需要一個很大的空間 來融化這些設備 或者是說要來呈現 那些很漂亮的影像 也許會不會是醫院的空這些設備或者是說要來呈現那些很漂亮的影像也許不過是醫院的空間設備房間的問題要變得更大一些之內 那當然也有剛剛像同學提到的說 比如說跨部會的一些合作的一些思考 這件事情應該是要由政府或國家來當責去主導這件事情 而且國家這件事情是我們台灣可以決定嗎 還是我們台灣其實是跟著國際趨勢的步調的? 要跟歐美走,還是要跟哪一個國家走? 要跟美國走,還是跟歐盟走? 這個部分會不會有相關的一些認知上的一些,比如說 法規上的需要去趕快去因應去調整的,或者是說他想要配合什麼樣的一個 政策願景再去跟著走,或是我們自己要去獨步全球走我們自己的路,這個部分也是需要政府或者是我們自己人民去,到底要去push政府還是政府引導人民去改變我們現在要的行為。對,那剛剛也提到說,現在AI的資料是大家餵給他的資料,那剛剛也有一個同學提了一個很不錯的一個想法 就是說,就讓我想到一件事情 如果我們餵給AI的資料是一個錯誤的資料 甚至是有歧視性的資料 比如說性別上的歧視 或者是種族上的歧視的資料的話 他未來判斷出來給我們資料 我們會不會也只是跟著我們前面的老師 前輩的思考模式繼續往下走 比如說我們曾經假設有認定某個種族 可能他的用藥上可能不需要這樣子 那會不會他經過過去一個比較錯誤或比較歧視性的判斷 讓他們一直用一個比較錯誤的給藥方式 但是也許他們其實是必須要被平等關懷的給要方式,但是可能過去的。 呃,有一些人他帶著其次的一些想法去給了一些這樣子的判斷,然後累積到一定的量之後,只是AI之後拋射投影出來的資料,他還是一樣是帶有其次性或者是可能不是那麼好的一個。可能是不太好的結果,這可能是我們後面的人必須要跟著一些 比如說想法或者是一些文化的脈絡, 也許要再自我調整。 另外,剛才老師也提到隱私性的問題, 比如說,我們一直提到基因, 基因是精準醫療的一件事情, 這時候好像也一直在精準醫療的一部分, 這時候好像也一直在強調所謂的基因序列的精準性, 然後跟投藥的一個問題, 那比如說我們的基因這部分已經有一些明確的東西出來, 這個部分還有辦法去做所謂的個人識別的去識別化, 如果說這些基因序列未來足夠的資料庫,或是有足夠的科技能力, 將所有資料庫排除, 我們將能夠在這件事上 進行更多的分析, 或是如何在更多的地方 保護病人, 並且在更多的地方 進行更多的精準的 互相回應, 以致於更多的 資訊產生, 或是如何從病人 相關的一些資訊可以做到更精準的醫療互相交互回應是更好的體質產生 或者是說怎麼樣去主導病毒相關的一些資訊 這是我以上的一些想法跟經驗 謝謝"

      "comment": "【陳昭文醫師】有新面孔、有熟面孔、有老面孔也有從來沒有看過的面孔 不過我想在這邊要跟大家分享一件事情 就是因為這本來是一堂課 但是因為我發現我們這堂課的講師太棒了 就是我們Isabel 我們侯律師其實她在人工智慧學校 做了很多很多播種的工作 那我們還有淑芳姐 她在所謂的人文跟社會方面的播種 我想這個影響力更大 所以我們後來在跟老師討論完之後 我們就把今天的這堂兩堂課 延展成一個工作坊 那工作坊其實我想在座有資深的也有資淺的 很重要的一點就是我們既然要播種 一定要向下播種 向上是管理啦 向下是播種 但是向上不是說強制性的管理 但是我們希望做出來的東西是大家可以共創的 但是學生很重要 他們才不會被拘泥於自己的角色以後 受限自己的發展 所以我今天很快速的跟大家分享一些故事 也不要講太複雜 我想說今天在座有很多很多所以我今天很快速的跟大家分享一些故事也不要講太複雜 我想說今天在座有很多很多非常有洞見 很有思維能力的人都比我們還厲害 我只是講一些我們過去發生過的小故事 不過我想今天的主題就是要用所謂的AI的發展 希望大家能夠去思考 哪一些是我們能夠協助完成 我們叫做以病人為中心的照護 我想在那個文稿裡面我們已經寫很多了 不過我想我很快速的講幾個故事 這故事是我之前常常講過的 就是說我們從 Vision to Reality 的過程 你要先想像 再到具象的過程 可是我 我們最近聽很多候選人說科學理性無史對不對to reality 的過程你要先想像再到具象的過程可是我 呃 我們最近聽很多候選人說科學理性無時對不對 所以我們講科學要怎麼變成是真正的行動 其實我自己就 呃 常常會碰到很多的困難 我們既覺得這是科學 但是他就沒有辦法轉化成行動 所以我一直覺得科學其實是一個對話 對話我們要跟誰對話 用生活的基礎 然後用系統性的方法去找到一個解法 那這個解法我就會常在問 我現在是誰 我需要解決什麼問題 那我們過去其實講的事情都非常簡單 我常在說其實我要解決的問題就是 在對的時間 我抱歉有點嚇到大家 在對的時間把對的病人送到對的地方 但是在這個過程裡面困不困難? 很困難,因為我們其實把這些路線都送好了 你要碰到一個對的醫護團隊還是有點困難 所以我自己本身在處理外傷 我通常會碰到很多很多病人的旅程 這個旅程大家可以理解 它有牽涉到很多很多的關係人 但是最後如果我們花了很多很多的時間 但是處理了很多的關係的事件 但是只有成就了一個survivor 那這個人的經驗有沒有辦法去讓所有的人去重新再回收、再利用 甚至讓沒有參與過的這些人去理解 所以我一直覺得學習很大的重點就是在回饋 如果大家能夠從今天的審議的工作坊學到很多東西 我會很開心 那我會覺得大家應該會比我更開心 因為很重要的一點這裡面的一個主軸養分就叫溝通 如果我們沒辦法溝通 我們沒辦法繼續往下走 為什麼我會很強調這件事情 因為我自己在處理病人 我們不是坐在診間跟病人溝通 我們是一群人在處理一個病人 所以我一直發現 哇 天啊 這個溝通非常非常的重要 因為它會造成很多很多的骨暢 當我們習慣於做同樣的事情的時候 我是外科醫師 我就會做外科醫師的思維 我是急診醫師 就用急診醫師的做法 那我現在ICU 我永遠不會去管ICU以外的事情 所以這就會造就大家沒有在溝通 就會讓我們剛剛講的這個learning cycle被破壞掉 所以我大概看到這些問題 在好幾年前我們就一直在想 如果我要解決那個對的時間在對的 把病人送到對的地方 我都很想一下子就搞定了 那我的結果是什麼? 就是每個人都在想他要怎麼做 但是實際上真的沒辦法做 所以這時候需要的事情就是在2014年 這個跟大家再次的講一次 這個為什麼是一個很有歷史意義的地點 因為在2014年我們在這邊辦了 台灣第一次的Covid Health Care 這個叫做第一次的醫療黑客鬆 那時候可能大家還不太清楚 什麼叫黑客鬆 有50個非常有視野 非常有關心人文 甚至要解決真正的問題的夥伴 從北中南一起聚集在這個地方 聚集在這個地方討論什麼事情 因為那時候在2014年的年中發生了氣爆 所以我們在氣爆前就儲備了 但是我們都希望 我們不是要top down的給大家指引 而是希望說去呼出來 大家有沒有什麼願景 那這時候可不可以具象的去做 所以這是 這看起來很熟悉的位置對不對 地板不一樣 人變老了 有一些人 然後這個是2018年我們把這邊想像跟具象的過程才有辦法跟總統去報 那時候才成就第一次的叫做救急救難以戰痛的事情 所以大家可以理解,這個事情絕對不是一天就可以促成的 而是花很多時間找很多人一起溝通 那這個溝通的過程其實我們就強調要所謂的資料跟科學的民主化過程 一定要大家的聲音要出來 所以你可以發現溝通、溝通、再溝通 還是在開工作坊還是在貼便利貼 所以大家等一下就會體驗到這個魔力 因為為什麼?因為這些東西會開始讓大家收斂出我們今天想要出來的結果是什麼 不光光只是文字語言 甚至可能是一個圖像 但是我想今天有很棒的老師 會來這邊引導我們 希望我們今天所做的事情 未來會變成是有人來幫我們 虔誠 勘詳的過程 所以剛剛在講的事情 其實在2014年 在更早以前其實在談 一直到現在變成是國家的政策 其實這一步路走了好幾年 走了好幾年之後我們看到的,其實還是有很多人願意繼續跨出每個人的領域去做一些溝通,去做什麼事情。主持人李仲敬現在真實的線例就跟我們在這個場子裡面一起跟我們等一下會繼續來討論 所以我們做什麼事情 就是把問題丟出來給大家看 給關係人看 交通局看到了 消防局看到了 更多人看到了 所以陳其邁也看到了 所以那時候我們在大會報報 這些一三通的資料再重新給大家看的時候 好 市長下令 這麼多人要一起來協作什麼事情 就是榮幸會智到平安這件事情 所以這件事情是不是一個人 ICU主任可以做了嗎 不是 也不是佩玲可以做的 也不是剛剛在招待大家的佳文可以做的 是一群人要一起做 做了什麼事情 溝通 溝通 再溝通 大家可以發現嗎 所以凝聚了2018年的東西能量一直到2023年 這個團隊其實又得到了總統盃,又得到了政府的backup,要進行所謂道路交通的改善,而不是說只是單純講講而已。其實就在教我們要怎麼讓這個變成是一個民主就是我們控制跟我們的 對它能夠體現我們現在的困境去解決我們的問題 絕對不是只是單一一個人可以決定 而是大家一起來共同創造 所以人工智慧的民主在哪裡 今天大家可以討論看看 我想老師很棒 所以我最後留的這張相片就是我在診間的 我在教這個病人 教他怎麼去照顧他的傷口 但是他的確教我的學生 大家可以看到嗎 我教了這個病人 然後他們在教學門診之後 回來教我的學生要怎麼去看他的傷口的恢復的狀況 所以人工智能某方面也是類似像我的這種感覺 我們或許如果我餵給你你吃得不順 那我希望你想吃什麼菜 你跟我講 那今天的所有參與的人 都是在跟我們一起在做想像到具象化的過程 所以假設我 這是我跟今天兩位講師講的 我的寫的病例 我就認為說一個主體 叫做13歲的小男生 我的關係人有好多,有paramedics,EMT的人,又加護病房的醫師,又急診的醫師,ICU的醫師 那他經歷了什麼事情,這就是我現在我看到的 我們病歷室的夥伴在那邊,看到建銘在那裡 我們寫了很多病歷,我們已經做了很多改革了,但是我們還是不滿意,所以我就許願請大家等一下用到的Chapter GTE來幫我把這個圖畫出來,可以嗎? 他就幫我畫出來斷手斷腳,他的關係人怎麼做?所以我一直覺得我們其實還有很多可以改善的部分,但是要不要繼續往前進其實永遠不嫌晚,我想說接下來我把時間交給Isabel謝謝各位 謝謝 好 謝謝陳醫師還有這個高一的大家"

      "comment": "那個投影片有一個QR code 那你掃了這個QR code 你就可以得到這個投影片 這個資料是可以帶走的 如果你覺得我講話語速非常快的話 你可以自己開手機錄音 對,沒有問題 對,那投影片可以帶走 那拿到這個投影片呢 應該是不會後悔 因為這個投影片非常非常有 有足夠強大的知識量這樣子。 那我叫Timo,然後我在台大醫院資訊室,然後我是一個工程師。 那我今天會介紹大圓模型在醫療領域的提示化工程跟產品化這樣子。 這樣子。 好,呃,剛有講,就是我來自G0B,然後我現在也在做一個叫臺灣Bench的一個評估,呃,大圓模型的一個評測的基準這樣子。 好,大家都知道在醫院,呃,其實你有很多資料,它會因為骨腸效應或者是因為隱私或倫理議題被監管。那這個監管呢,會導致你,會導致你就是,你在做很多事情的時候會遇到IRB, 會比如說像是人理試驗的那個倫理委員會啊, 或是醫學研究的倫理委員會這樣子。稍微一下 OK 那我們現在我的醫院其實現在是可以使用大圓模型的 那我們做了一些隱私跟倫理上面區分,比如說呃,合成式的資料,我們是使用那個就是呃,模擬的或者是假資料,或者是純粹合成資料,我們用open AI的API。 然後呢,如果是一些特案準用的資料,比如說他有一些隱私或倫理,我們有去個資化或者是使用呃,就是統計之後的數值,我們會使用Azure OpenAI,它一個沙箱的環境這樣子。 那當然,幣院稍微有一點經費可以建自己的代源模型,所以我們其實有兩張A100可以算自己的代源模型,那我們會把一些共生資料放進去什麼是共生資料呢? 就是不屬於我 但是與我一起生存生存的 呃,生活的資料 就是我被授權可以使用這些資料 但這些資料不屬於我 當我離開這個場域 或者我離開這個區域 我就不能再使用這樣的資料 比如說病人的病歷資料 好 那一開始呢我們是使用OpenAI做一些實驗,那這實驗我們可能使用合成的資料,因為我在醫院工作,所以我其實知道每一個跟醫療相關的資料,它的格式規格以及它是什麼樣的型態。 我也請OpenAI幫我生成一些合成用的資料,比如說下面有一個咒語,抄了就可以直接使用,丟進去它就會幫你生出一些符合60個病人的資料,然後它的生命真用的Ager Open AI的殺傷環境裡面。 好,當然就是剛才有講有一些是醫院自己的整合資料庫或者是跟健保相關資料庫然後有申請過 IRB 倫理審查的這些過審的資料 我們有放到自建的代言模型裡面 那到底要怎麼樣評估一個生存是 AI 的好壞呢 所謂的好其實會因為情境而有所不同 那這邊所謂的情境的不同是說, 當比如說我需要去推論未知的交互作用, 比如說吃這個藥對那個病有什麼效果, 或者是我在猜這個病人可能會有什麼狀況的時候, 他給我一些創意,其實是好的。 那像老藥新用啊,或者是新代白質結質結構、藥物熱穩定等,當他可以告訴我一些不知道的事情,而我拿著這些事情去驗證這是不是真的,是有這樣的狀況的時候,我會認為他有一些創意、有一些湧現眾正確的答案,或一定要給醫生或院內的同仁正確的答案的時候,我們會希望它在我們特定的模板裡面把答案挑出來。 比如說院內的括號指引,它一定只能出現是我們家的醫生而不是隔壁醫院的醫生,它選出來的這個不能是幻覺,一定是我們實際有這個科,有這個醫生,然後有看這個診。 當然也有一些院內路線指引的部分,或者是PheWAS的研究,就是有一些病跟疾病之間可能有一些共病的關係,或者是基因上面跟這個病可能會有一些共病的關係 舉個例子好了,像是有一個病人他在某一天之後他突然對納豆過敏 那為什麼他會對納豆過敏呢? 我們可能把過去的一些病理資料收集之後,然後拿去分析會發現 他曾經去衝浪,那為什麼衝浪會跟納豆過敏有關係呢? 好,我們去看,原來他跟醫生講過他被水母咬了 所以我們才發現某一天在被水母咬過之後 你可能會對納豆過敏 那這是一個處理疾病跟疾病之間的關係 以及在正確的資料裡面選出資料這件事 當然我們也需要一些他幫我們改寫或者是幫我們修正一些文案,比如說今天某個醫生非常理智、非常理性,從開刀房走出來。底下很難突然轉換成一個很暖心的狀況跟家屬說明一些內容 這時候我們有一些輔助的方案 比如說把文案調整成比較暖心的內容 然後再提供給第一線同仁作為一種參考使用這樣子 好 那到底要怎麼樣評估我們使用的代言模型是不是好的一個模型 我們現在其實有一些給語言模型考試的方案,比如說告訴他有300個呃,題目希望他考一個分數出來,我們看看好不好?當然我們也會有一些不公開題目,然後呃,在那個就是呃,私底下考這個代言模型。 好,這是我們院內的一個APP,APP裡面有一個叫AI建議的,你可以直接問他說,哎,我我我現在狀況什麼,然後他後面會去那個大圓模型,然後他有一個持續變好的這個進步的那個飛輪在轉這樣子,但是實際上,呃,當你要把高頻的診斷碼或者是統計後的值,或者是到甚至直接把轉診記錄或者是把EMR或EHR放進去的時候,這時候那個IRB就會來問你說,哎,那個這個我們認為有隱私疑慮怎樣怎樣,對,那所以,呃,基本上都是會遇到需要通過隱私或倫理審查這一關卡好 那我今天會特別聚焦在那個生成式 AI 關於代源模型的部分 我們現在不管是哪一間醫院 就是只要是醫療場域 大部分都在做這三類 第一個是做對話式機器人 就是客服應用或推薦應用 那第二個是更好的 KM 就是你在特化的知識庫裡面選出正確答案這件事情 再來是智慧代理人 比如說有些智慧選擇或是任務執行這樣子 好 那這邊呢 我等一下說明的案例都是新聞來的 我並沒有要說別人家產品問題 但是我會說明一下 人家作者可能曾經走過什麼樣的路 然後可能踩過什麼樣的坑 遇到什麼樣的問題 這樣子 好 那我這邊的心得其實是 我認為基於事實跟基於推論 他會有兩種完全不一樣的未來 也就是說他要做 這個提示工程跟產品化 他會有完全不一樣的路徑這樣子 如這邊有一個案例是台北榮總做這個提示工程跟產品化,它會有完全不一樣的路徑這樣子。 如,呃,這邊有一個案例是台北榮總,他們用Azure OpenAI,然後他們是有做呃,衛教手冊啊,然後基因型的比較啊,然後文章生成之後幫醫生簡短那個呃,編輯文章的時間,然後做分析資料跟採出表格這樣子然後中山復一呢 這邊是有一個對話式機器人 他幫助護理師可以快速的找到衛教單章 對,然後可以 就是加速那個 照護流程的自動化跟行動化這樣子 那他找到那個衛教單章 可以快速的翻譯成多語系 好,再來是 呃剛剛講的這一類的產品,他們其實叫,呃,用的一種技術叫做Reg,他的做法是從資料裡面,呃,切割出來之後放進,呃,某一些,呃,向量分析的資料庫,然後從裡面選出正確答案。 但其實這一類的問題目前在技術上會有一些限制,比如說你雖然利用模板找出答案,所以它可以是幻覺,它不會是幻想的。但是呢,這個語言模型如果你用的,你選擇的語言模型如果不夠大,或者是它學習的量不夠多的話,它有時候會有學習忘舊的問題或者是他會有學錯難忘的問題 比如說他以前學錯了某個藥品的使用方式 他以後就一直回答同樣的錯誤的方式 一直沒有辦法糾正這樣子 那可能會有一些童年陰影 那再來就是目前其實微教單章的話 處理表格或處理圖片的部分 都會有一些困難的地方 有沒有辦法先把一些資料做一些總結結論之後精煉出來然後讓它再變成一個 QA 然後再進行就是跟大羽模型互動這樣子 其實我等一下要舉一個例子是 真人在 QA 裡面找出最接近的答案到底可不可以?\" 主持人:\"這邊提的另外一個例子是中國服役,他們有一個致海的語音生成系統,就是醫生跟病人還有醫,或者是列出重點的這些功能,提取出關鍵字或進行摘要。這一類呢,其實也還是會遇到一些問題,比如說在摘要的時候畫錯重點, 就是明明這個病人對某一些藥物是過敏的,但是大預言模型可能忘記了。這對人來說是非常重要的,因為他可能吃這個藥就是會過敏,然後不能使用。 另外有一些行話,就是醫生可能會講一些專用術語,但是預言模型有時候可能也會有幻覺,或者是他不知道那案語是什麼意思。 他不知道那暗語是什麼意思對,那當然現在其實有一些醫生他們是堅持 就是我講的每一個字就是要照本宣科完全不動地列出來這樣子 所以他也不能接受有人幫他重新把行話變成是一般的通用術語這樣子 那下面有一個咒語 你可以使用這個咒語直接把你想要精煉或者是想要做總結的文字片段直接變成重點。 這是一篇Nature的論文,這篇論文最神奇的地方就是,它幫助病患在入的時候,有85%會在院內死亡。 這是一篇很有趣的論文,他使用代言模型去做推論,效果非常地好。 智慧代理人的部分,這邊有一些架構跟模型,基本上就是請代言模型幫你使用某個工具這樣子那呃這邊舉一個例子 這是G0B的例子 那這個案例並未實際的產品化 就是呃我們以前可能呃 Google或是Ciri沒有這麼聰明 但是未來應該是可以做到比如說 呃ok那呃 代理模型請幫我用流速計算機計算 呃什麼樣的體積流速 然後他變成幾公斤 然後由機器人幫你朗讀出來 他正確應該是要什麼樣的最終流速 然後並且自動化幫你記錄在護理記錄中 由於是語言模型去用計算機 而且過程都有重新朗讀讓人做確認 所以可以不用擔心 代言模型產生幻覺的這個問題 好,那在動動手使用代言模型之前呢 我舉一個有趣的例子 就是那個有時候電話會打來問資訊室說 那個處方籤條碼怪怪的掃不到 對,那個接電話的人就會翻手冊 欸那個手冊裡面有一個QA是寫說 印處方籤怪怪的 喔好 應該是這個要回答民眾 但實際上人去了現場發現一件事情 是 其實是Barcode Reader摔壞了 所以掃不到處方籤的條碼 OK 你用程式去處理這些文字的時候 基本上你會覺得 處方籤條碼怪怪的少不掉 跟印處方籤條碼怪怪的 這處方籤條碼怪怪的 這幾個字都很接近 在向量空間中很接近 數學模型中很接近 但實際上要解決的問題是什麼 實際上要解決的是 Barcode reader 摔壞了 OK 好那我有些心得分享解決問題是什麼實際上要解決的是Barcode reader摔壞了OK好 那我有些心得分享 就是我認為基於事實跟基於推論 他的方向跟方法是不一樣的 解方是不一樣 如果你是要做基於事實的話 你應該從生成內容轉念 選做選擇回應模板這件事情 就是從正確檔案中選出來 就不會有幻覺的問題 那如果是基於推論呢 如果你一開始就覺得要請他幫你推論某件事情 那他就不是事實查核引擎啊 你就不應該把它當成是像Google一樣直接從裡面選出一個正確答案這件事情 好 那呃其實因為場景的不同基於事實或基於推論會有一些差異這樣子。 好,那比如說有憑有據,或者是,呃,你有一些想要直接讓他開出考的一些問題,或者是你有一些情境是完全零容忍,不能有幻覺的狀況,那呃,做法可能會有一些不一樣這樣子。 呃,做法可能會有一些不一樣這樣子。 好,那現在其實有很多不一樣的語言模型可以選擇,不一定是確定GPT或OpenAI的語言模型。對,那呃,臺灣也有自己自己正在做那個代言模型的部分,對,那這邊有一個風味問題,風味問題是說,如果這個代言模型非常了解臺灣的在地文化的話,他應該會回答一些臺灣人才會知道的事情,或者是臺灣人在意的事情。 這邊在高雄有一個景點叫二地,二地的介紹是什麼?臺灣拉瑪目前在這些題目上面回答的都蠻好的。 台灣拉馬目前在這些題目上面回答都蠻好的 好那我覺得有一件事情很重要 就是要認識自己 pump is all you need 或是 pump is all you have 所以你目前的狀態呢 是呃你只需要用下咒語就可以達成 還是說你現在其實是你只有咒語 但你還有很多事情做不到這樣子 好 那今天可以帶走的咒語有 請使用繁體中文或臺灣用語 那為什麼要使用請這個字呢 在大語言模型裡面 有一群是他有收錄一般民眾講的話 跟專業人士講的話 如果你使用請的話 他在那個語言模型的路徑裡面 會最快速落到專業人士講的話裡面,因為大部分收錄這些專業,專業術語的文字很多時候都有有禮貌的用語,被同步收錄在請中。 好,那呃,也是可以做一些完全未知的預測,比如說這邊有一篇論文是做藥物協同性的癌症預測那他先把這個語言模型讓他學一些科學知識 然後再透過少量樣本 即使在零樣本的條件底下 也可以得到很高的預測的準確性這樣子 對,那這是一篇論文 OK,那其實今年ICD-TAM有新增5698個全新的 就是台灣醫學中心協會跟醫師協會 他們選出來一些新的ICD-10 那這些ICD-10在過去都沒有病人選中這些代碼 然後醫生也還沒有開始使用這些代碼 那我們要怎麼樣告訴醫生說 其實現在這些新的疾病你可以選這些新的代碼 OK 好,這是一個很有趣的問題 所以在,呃,這邊有公開,就是拋出一個議題就是 當我們要預測下一件會帶來重大變革的這件事情的時候 呃,也許可以先想想,就是這些重大的創新變革會解決什麼樣的問題? 好,那假設你一年之後會有全世界最好的代言模型你可以使用 那你想像未來五年的智慧醫療場景是什麼? OK,我們把麥克風交給淑芳老師给苏方老师"

      "comment": "還是應該 想講的時候就可以講 但我沒有特別想要回應前兩位 我其實會想到今天早上在Funding the Commons的 其中一個panel在討論一個話題 一樣其實就是關於AI跟Web3 然後裡面Numbers Protocol的創辦人提了一個例子 就是關於好萊塢前一陣子編劇跟電影公司之間 這個勞資的衝突 然後最後協商 然後他有提到說其實那個協商的一部分內容 其實就關於到底這些AI生成劇本 或者某一種像是劇本的demo的東西 使用這種工具的權利是誰可以用 然後我覺得那個就是放到傳統的 其實到任何一個產業都一樣 如果有一個工具是在勞工跟雇主之間 是可以改變他們的工作分工跟話事的 講話分配資源的權利的時候 他的確看起來像是一個大家需要去爭奪說 到底可以怎麼用 然後早上討論就有提到說 後來他們的勞資協議就定義了就是說 電影公司可以是把一個人工做出來的劇本的草稿 交給一個人工的編劇去論稿 然後付他一個錢 但是電影公司不可以是 一開始就先用AI生成的一個demo 然後因為這樣用更低一點的價錢 去外包給下面的編劇說你再去論稿 就是他們會認為說你在前端先用AI的工具之後 你就獨佔了某一個本來不屬於你的利潤 然後這個在原本勞資關係裡面是不平衡的 但是反過來聽起來編劇有比較大的權利是 他能不能夠應用AI的工具去幫助自己 更有生產力的創作更多的內容這件事 就在那個協商裡面 這個AI的工具是被兩邊這樣討論 那我會想到另外一個衝擊的點是 因為我當下覺得有一個點在於說 我們很容易把AI想成是一個提升生產力的工具 然後也的確現在可能會有越來越多的新創 他會針對不同的生活裡面的場景 工作裡面的場景去想 我應該要打造一個基於 也許LM創造出來的一個應用 可以幫助這個工作裡面的某一些細節環節做得更好 但是我覺得這東西跟我們在Web 2.0時代 在談平台經濟的時候很像 就是說問題是到底誰實質上握有這個AI的工具 他甚至有可能不是創造應用的新創公司 他到最後可能還是回到像OpenAI這樣 就是做了一個非常dominant 然後全世界都在用的這樣的語言模型 所以事實上我們會不會有點在重複 過去我們在Web 2.0時代所看到的就是 本來應該有一個東西是公共的開放的 如果我們覺得網路空間是一個開放的 那個關鍵技術就像在Web 2.0時代 大部分的社群媒體平台 他壟斷了你所有的資源 然後今天就算是我們上禮拜Web 3.0的讀書會 在讀希臘前財政部長的一本 亞尼斯的一本新書 他的定義所謂的科技封建主義 他裡面就提到說 事實上在Web 2.0的所有社群平台面前 就算你今天是傳統很大的電商零售商 你其實也是幫平台打工的人 因為你要曝光你還是必須基於平台 我覺得我們有可能在想像 那個會提升生產力的過程 如果沒有更早的去討論說 到底是誰實際握有這些工具的話 那有可能會再進入下一個循環 就是到最後它是一個非常不均等的狀態 就是編劇事實上並沒有因為他可以用那個工具 而解放自己 反而是把他自己跟那個AI工具的權利擁有者 綁得更深 而且那個關係更不對等"

      "comment": "我想要衍生上一位朋友講的結論 我先講結論 我的結論是開源的分散式的AI 可以在自己的電腦上面運作的 不管是Large Language Model 還是圖像生成式的Model 是一件很重要的事 但是它也是有隱憂的 第一個 好 開始就是ECHO 剛剛的概念是好萊塢罷工事件 我覺得大家可能可以先分成兩個情境去想像 我再拿近一點好了 第一個案例是 罷工的人在罷工的時候 資方用Large Language Model去生成劇本 因為劇本太方便了 所以編劇就被Layoff了 勞工就失業 資本繼續集中在資方身上 電影大家還是會看 肥皂劇不需要什麼太新奇的劇本 所以大家就繼續看 結果苦的是勞工 這是第一個情境 第二個情境 罷工的時候編劇回來上班了 編劇知道怎麼用Large Language Model 所以就用了LLM來幫他生成劇本 他使用LLM以後 他一週可能本來要工作40個小時 現在只需要工作20個小時 或許品質還更不錯 結果他剩下的20個小時就躺平領錢 大家一樣繼續看這個劇 其實結論上是一樣的 但是中間的差別在哪裡呢 差別在於到底是資方使用這個工具 還是勞方先學會使用這個工具 我覺得兩件事情的差異 並不是在工具如何好用 而是在工具以什麼樣的姿態被大家使用 這是第一個 所以什麼樣的社會大家比較喜歡 我個人的猜測是 大家或許比較喜歡後者這個案例吧 那編劇要怎麼先接觸到工具 而非資方先外包給外面更便宜的公司 或是資方先掌握這個工具呢 我個人認為是一個好上手 而且很容易被大家給使用的工具 而且這個工具可能是開源的 或者是可以宰下來自己調整的工具 當然還沒有討論到它多好用與否 所以我個人認為像是在過去吧 Meet Journey跟Stable Diffusion 兩個都是Generative AI 圖像生成式的AI 那兩個發展的方向是完全不一樣的 Meet Journey就自己一直改版 那大家每個月付錢 它改版大家繼續用新功能 但是Stable Diffusion這邊是 它放在Hugging Face上面 它放在一些新的開源平台上面 大家可以自己去做Laura 也就是小模型去疊上去 那這個可以優化的狀態其實是非常快速的 一個是開源的地方 一個是封閉的地方 那剛剛我的推論是 開源且可以被客製化 自己去用的模型 很有可能可以幫助勞工 比較早被使用到這些工具 因為這些工具是相對免費 相對有自己的資源 可以自己去長出來的 但是我覺得現在有一個很大的隱憂是 開源的模型背後可能藏著很多被污染的東西 舉一個案例就好 中國的模型 其實現在越來越多中國的開源語言模型 但是我們的好朋友去中國工作的告訴我們說 他們在整理資料的時候 其實已經寫過過濾的引擎了 這個過濾的引擎是符合某種意識型態的 可是它釋出的當然是免費的 大家在用的過程其實很容易忽略掉 它背後其實已經經過某種思想審查的狀態 因此當我們可以見到的是 免費跟開源的模型被越來越多人使用的時候 這種影響力是被放大的 這種影響力背後可能隱藏的是 某種意識型態或思想的風險 以上是我的想法"

      "comment": "剛剛前幾位參與者講到 第一個是 到底是開源的模型 會讓比較好 還是像open AI這樣子 它是建立它自己平台上的生態系 比較好 我自己會比較持相反意見 我認為開源的模型 並沒有辦法真正解決掉 就是大家的問題 因為事實上來講 網際網路的出現 它某種程度上就是把 傳播訊息的這個方式 給開源了出去 讓每個人都可以做 但是大家也都知道說 就是因為每個人都可以做到 這個開源的訊息 所以到了Web 2.0的時候 就會需要有一個mediator 還是會需要有一個mediator 去協助我們去做 就是相關的訊息的整理 那mediator出現之後 那到最後就變成是 我們現在的社群平台 所以我自己會覺得說 如果開源到最後 它還是會 就是如果我們人的本身的nature 就是本來的天性 就是一個會導引到 這樣子的一個狀況 我們終究還是需要一個平台 來幫我們整理好 做我的事情的時候 那我們自己就 我們就沒有辦法去 真正的享有這樣子的一個 就是我們所想像的那種 很理想的自由自在的一個狀態 那如果是這樣子的話 我會寧願說 那我們就把這些 我們就讓你們這些大平台 自己發展 但是我們要課予你相關的obligation 譬如說像剛剛的accountability的部分 或者是剛剛講到的資料控制的部分 我會覺得說 那如果是這樣子的話 有的時候可能會解決掉這樣場館的問題"

      "comment": "來來來 他下一個他下一個 好 對 我認為我覺得問題 要認清一件事 人類世界的問題是會一直存在的 沒有一個終極解決所有問題的方法 你總是採取了這個solution之後 會跑出其他更多的solution出來 那所以呢 在現在如果在選擇開源還是閉源的這兩件事情上 我覺得你要考慮的應該是什麼樣的選擇 是能夠facilitate最多人得到控制權的 就是當有更多人能夠得到比較多的 直接控制技術的這個可能性 不是說你給他控制權他就願意 因為有很多人就是有access 但是其實可能還是比較願意的人 才有辦法去實際上運用那個控制的 就是那一個使用那個權利 那所以我覺得不需要不要跳得那麼快 就是說好 開源可能沒有辦法解決所有問題 但是呢 在這兩個選擇上 特別是站在台灣的角度 你如果不用開源 我們連訓練人才的可能性都沒有 你連把你的博士生研究生碩士生老師 能夠知道怎麼去訓練大型語言模型的可能性都沒有 其實是透過Lama2這樣的模型 我們才現在有一批學生和老師 他們在學習怎麼去train這個model 因為台灣在技術發展上面 我們過去只在比較重視的是影像辨識的問題 其實做語言模型的人非常非常少 甚至可以說根本就沒有 那李鴻一老師他很清楚狀況 但是他也並沒有實作的經驗 一個問題是我們沒有那個基礎 就是我們資料是我們的痛點 我們並沒有開始AI的life cycle的基礎 第一件事是資料 但是繁體中文資料就不夠 就沒有 所以呢 必須透過這個 其實在這個開源的模型基礎上 我們才有辦法開始做這件事 我覺得這個是我們在現在必須認清的事情"

      "comment": "我覺得最重要的事情應該是說 因為我是學政治學的人 我思考事情的方式可能會從大家的 在這個場域裡面的權利是不是都平衡的方式去想 就是我覺得開源它已經某種程度上 去平衡了大公司還有政府的權利 讓更多人在這個市場這個場域上是有平等的 可是當我們今天把場域改到開源的時候 可能會變成是有比較好的技術能力的人 他可能在這個場域上會有比較多的權利 那就比如說剛剛那個誰 剛剛有另外一位參與者說 那個編劇的那個argument裡面就是 編劇可能可以用開源的工具去寫劇本 可是我們回想起來的話可能是 其實如果編劇他只是文字專門的話 他可能沒有那個技術的能力去 去拿到這個開源的這個AI工具 然後自己去用程式去補強它 變成一個自己理想的程式 所以這個開源可能就對他而言沒有辦法幫助到他 他可能還要去花另外一筆錢去請一個會寫程式的人 然後幫他做一個開源的這個東西 可是剛剛他有講到說 現在很多開源的工具很腐爛 裡面品質不好甚至有對岸的一些政治語言 可是這個問題並不是我們不能從自由市場裡面 想辦法去用力量平衡它 比如說有人可以去做一個排行榜說 我覺得這開源工具超爛的我們不要用它 然後有人開源工具B我覺得這很好 那就是因為它是自由的 所以每個人都有權利去說你的評價跟想法 所以爛的產品它可能就可以被平衡掉 那好的產品它可以留在世界上 然後我覺得我剛剛也想要分享一下 剛剛講那個AI telemetry 跟孫燕姿的事情 我想到的另外一件事情是 就是在歐盟裡面就是人是有權利被遺忘的 就是我可以把我的所有資料刪除 在網路上全部刪除 可是我看到台灣的公車上 有時候會有可能諸葛亮的AI廣告 然後就是鄧麗君是一個台灣跟對岸的鄰居 都很喜歡的一個女歌手 可是我在看他們的時候或許他們的歌迷覺得很開心 可是我在想說如果我是他們的家屬的話 或是今天不要是鄧麗君或諸葛亮 是一個已經過世的人 那我不確定說他們這些影像是從哪裡來的 可是我看他一直在出現 那我是他的家人我會怎麼想 或許我會覺得很難過 然後為什麼我已經過世的情人 我的肖像一直被這樣運用 或是這個人他根本沒有同意說他過世之後 他的肖像可以被這樣運用 可是這些東西在抓取公共資料生成影像的AI裡面 好像是不可避免的 所以我覺得這是另外一個我們要思考的地方"

      "comment": "就是我覺得資料的 這個部分它也有點到另外一個問題是 到底資料的量夠不夠 還有就是如果資料不夠的話 它會不會變得更少 因為現在的狀況就會是 從語言的角度來說的話 其實現在整個少數語言或者是 冰鵝語言的 它的情況在人工智慧出現之後 是變得更加嚴峻的 原因是因為這些語言 它本來就已經缺乏相關的語料庫跟相關的資料 那同時因為它本來使用的人就少 所以它其實大家會 在人工智慧的出現之後 常識語言像英文或者是 其他的一些主要在使用的語言 他們的資料會爆炸性的增長 而這些資料爆炸性的增長之後 它又會進到人工智慧的模型當中 不斷的被訓練不斷的被回饋 那在這樣的一個情況底下 會不會我們反而在 我們要針對資料量不足的這些東西 去做相關的就是加強 甚至是去提供更多有關這個資料的輸入 或者是說如果是像台灣的話 台灣如果要運用各種人工智慧的一些應用 為什麼現在可能好像大家都突然間 推不起來的原因 很多時候都是因為我們想要用這個東西 然後我們已經有了一個model在這邊了 但是我們反而是缺乏相關的資料 或者是我們的資料量 不足夠讓我們訓練出一個能力很好的model 譬如說我們可能要求 它的能力的精準度要到95% 甚至是80%以上 但是我們現在的資料的精準度 可能只能夠讓我們訓練的出來 精準度60%的東西 那在這樣的話 那它還是一個不堪用的一個模型 所以資料量如何去衡量的問題 它會是一個很大的問題 那同樣的資料量 另外一個連結到的就會是隱私的問題 就是你在使用資料的時候 這個資料的主體要如何受到回饋 這件事情目前在台灣是沒有辦法定性的跟定論的 資料的主體要如何從它所受出的資料當中獲得回饋 以及它的連結的部分 要怎麼樣去建立這樣子的一個連結 目前是沒有這樣子的一個基礎 那既然沒有基礎的話 那資料的主體就第一個是 它造成的第一個結果就會是 資料的主體要嘛就是不願意把資料釋出來 所以沒有資料可以用 第二個就是你必須要去用各種各樣的方式去取得資料 反而讓資料主體陷於隱私 或者是其他個人資料洩漏上面的 個人資料或者是其他資料洩漏上面的危害 所以它會導致這樣的結果 所以如何去建立一個比較良好的資料使用的一個機制 還有對於資料的性質等等的 就要去做基礎的定性 我覺得這件事情它會是目前人工智慧 至少在我來看會是一個最大的衝擊"

      "comment": "主要是講open source相關的 現在大家在討論 MLM有沒有需要open source這件事情 但open source跟non-open source的這件事情 已經發展超過20年 但對大家來講其實沒有什麼太大的感覺 就是你可能知道你的Android手機底層是open source的 就是Mobile OS 然後你可能知道 你可能不知道 你的Mac OS底層是open source的PBSD 那這件事情有什麼影響 就是當我們在討論這些東西的時候 其實易用性是一個非常重要的 就是我們要怎麼讓一般的人願意去用 就是我們20年前在討論open source的時候 我們一直在討論說 為什麼學校要教育大家用Windows 然後為什麼大家要學習用Office 為什麼我們不用Open Office 但這件事情非常殘酷的就是 Open Office就是難用 所以當我們要考慮底層的結構的時候 也許我們可以先考慮 現在是一個另外的轉折點 就是我們要考慮的是 這個industry到底要長什麼樣子 就是它的產業是長什麼樣子 而不是我們一直去討論那個kernel要長什麼樣子 就是當我們有一個非常好的open source的kernel 但沒有人要用 這件事情還是不會發生 就是它還是不會轉變 然後為什麼macOS可以這麼好用 就是因為它的上面的那一層aqua就是好用 雖然它底層是VBSD 但沒有人在意 所以易用性我覺得是 當我們在考慮這一個整個新的產業的時候 我們要去考慮的這件事情 就是我們要讓商業公司 在增加它的上面那一層易用性 可以有賺到錢 那我們底層 也許我們現在是用chain GPT 但我們因為這個產業起來 我們才有機會就是 比如說chain自己的LM 或者是我們可以直接換掉底層的kernel 這個東西才會有正向的循環 而不是我們一直在討論說 我們要去build我們自己的 就像20年前我們一直在 台灣政府跟中國政府都想要build自己的Linux kernel 那這件事情就算你做到了 但沒有人要用還是沒有用"

      "comment": "就是綜合剛剛前面的幾位講者的一些想法 其實我想到針對那第一點 要讓所有人有控制權這件事情 我覺得第一個是控制權這個意識 他可能就是需要被教育的 因為其實很多時候我們從小的教育裡面 大家就不會告訴我們 其實我們可以有控制權 我們可以主動的去完成很多事情 甚至我們可以跳脫一些一般傳統的思考 而去挑戰一些現實 去自己開發一些新的工具 所以我覺得第一個 我們可能要從教育上面去著手 去告訴大家控制權這件事情 是一個你應該被拿回來的事情 然後另外一個就是 當然如果AI要怎麼樣讓更多人擁有控制權 那當然就是我們要教大家如何使用AI 過去幾個月 Accupace打開來大概都有三百堂AI的課程 不管是Prompt的使用等等 我覺得這件事情當然也都是會不斷的向前演進的 我覺得這個教育其實他可能不光 因為現在大部分人都是從一些商業或是工作流 現在很流行這個名詞 工作流的考量來說 AI對我們可以有什麼樣的應用 幫助我們提升效率等等 但我覺得他可能也像前面有人提到 他可能必須要向下扎根 可能要在一些學生或是從小就去教育他們 你可以拿回控制權 你可以有這些工具去使用 那你應該如何使用這些工具 我覺得這可能也都會 更有助於所謂Open Source的這個概念的推廣 那另外一個我覺得從教育上還要再做一件事情 就是過去我們看這個東西 好像都有一點把它太 我不知道這樣講對不對 但有一點太分化了 就是Open Source社群很好 那GitHub打開 那麼多東西我都要怎麼用 沒有人知道怎麼用 那我覺得這中間缺的是一個設計的人才 那這個設計指的可能不是程式的設計 我相信台灣的工程師 那個肝的能力大概毋庸置疑 但是這中間通常缺少了很多 介面的設計 流程的設計 服務的設計 等等的這方面的人才 我覺得如果也能夠在教育上 多培養一些這方面的人才的話 也有可能可以有控制權 能夠更普及 然後大家能夠更善於利用AI"

      "comment": "我只是想要回 就是一樣我覺得很同意剛剛教育的方面 我覺得要培養大眾的認知 說開發一個AI的工具或是MLM的工具 並不是你把一群很會寫程式的人聚在一起 就會生出好的東西 那有時候他開發出來的語言 那個詞語根本就不精確 但問題是開發 如果這個開發的人 他認知他開發的東西 就只是一個純技術的東西的話 他沒有語言學或是沒有歷史方面的知識的話 他開發出來的工具 真的就會是悲劇一場 所以我覺得剛剛有一些朋友講到說 已經有一些行動 是開始收集地方的一些詞彙跟歷史 我覺得那個都是很好的行動 那我覺得可是要怎麼樣去鼓勵業者 去知道說我們現在政府或是法人 有一些這些資源 我覺得那可能是政府方面可以去鼓勵業者 或是出版一些指引 去鼓勵想要開發MLM的業者 說我們現在已經有這些團體去收集地方的語言 那可以幫助你把你的模型變得更專業 那你們可以來跟我們諮詢或使用 那或許這個是另外一個可以保存地方歷史文化的契機 還有就是可能在每個大學裡面的 就是有AI相關 會碰到AI的科系 比如說資工系或是任何的相關學系的話 我覺得真的要跟他們強調說 跨領域的教育是非常重要的 你不要覺得說你以後開發模型 就是只要寫程式就可以了 或許就是政府必須去鼓勵說 比如說你今天想要開發的一個工具 那或許你可以去跟 你可以去找中文系的老師跟學生 或是你找歷史系的老師跟學生 去談一談說你今天發展出來的工具 在他們使用者的角度而言 到底那個詞語專不專業 我覺得這是打破跨領域的一個 這個藩籬是很重要的 然後第三個是我覺得 剛剛講到大家對於自己的資料 或是任何的身份有最多控制權的這件事情 我覺得是政府應該要去想說 其實很多科技相關的立法跟政策 民眾都沒有參與到 那之後這麼多災難會發生 那當然就是你一開始就沒有去問 盡可能去問所有的人說 這個立法下去之後會發生什麼樣的事情 那當然災難就會發生 那這個事情其實在全世界都是一樣 那或許從今天開始 政府或許可以去制度化說 我們比如說我們今天要來制定一個AI基本法 那我在立法的過程中 我可不可以制度化一個 讓各行各業的民眾都可以來參與 來貢獻意見的制度性的討論 比如說我們現在已經有Join平台 我們有VTaiwan 那我們怎麼去制度化這個討論 然後讓民眾不要覺得說 這都是大家科技界的事情 我都不能有意見 那我覺得這樣可能會讓過程 這個立法會比較完善 然後後面的災難可能會少一點 謝謝前衛兩位的分享"

      "comment": "其實他們已經把我大部分想講的講完了 所以我坐在這邊已經一會了 然後先講結論 我想說的是其實我覺得 AI所面臨的問題 並不是AI所產生的 就是沒有AI我們還是一樣有這些衝擊 只是AI擴大了這些衝擊 那結論上來說 我認為的解決方法是提升我們科技及民主的識讀的能力 然後你們剛剛講的教育是影響很大一件事 然後再來我想要講的是 可能詞彙的選擇 或者是對話的建構 講得更具體來說是 我認為其實在場各位 我們已經算是一群很熱的嗎 我們就是一群可能多少都了解一點法律 或了解一點技術的人聚在一起 然後我們討論了一個有一點技術門檻或知識門檻一個領域的東西 可是我覺得這種有點在天上飄的東西 我很期待或希望它可以更落實在我們這片土地上 那要如何開始 我會期盼的是 能不能試著挑一些更接地氣的詞彙來描述這件事來溝通 我們每個人可能來自不同的領域不同背景 可是我一直覺得 我自己的感受是 所有的權力的建構 然後知識的壟斷 它的歷史的演進都是一樣的 例如說我可能受過法律的訓練 我們法律就會講說什麼構成要件該當 或者講說這個該當其實來自於法國哲學的概念 或者是我們會講民事訴訟法上的訴訟擔當 那擔當這個詞其實是來自日本的概念 我們就是一群受過這個訓練的人 然後用我們的詞彙來壟斷這個知識 所以律師就可以賺錢嗎 那其實回到 就是這件事情的本質是共通的 不是只有AI才會這樣 AI就是一群工程師 他懂演算法、懂數學、懂開發的技術 所以他也用一樣的方式來壟斷這個市場 然後接下來他建構出了一套權力和機制 那所以回到我剛剛前提想說的是 我認為就是現在所提出來的問題 都是本來就存在 只是AI擴大這件事 那解決的方法是 我們可以更多元的這樣對話 然後試著用更接地氣的方式 更親近的方式 來讓更多 例如說饒育人界的方式 所以我想說就是 剛才我們前一個階段討論的是 開源或閉源的問題 可是可能對很多人來說 就離開我們這個場子 就是我們可能在場的人都知道GitHub 然後知道很多開源資料在哪裡 可是離開這裡可能大多數人是不知道的 甚至就算我們在場的人都知道GitHub 但我們真的有誰有這個能力 真的可以去使用這些開源資料 然後做了正確的使用 或者是像剛才這位就是分享者提到的是說 他說歐盟有備忘權 那我相信很多人可能聽過這個詞彙 但是呢 我有點好奇的是 在場不知道有沒有人像我一樣無聊 去把所有大公司的AI隱私政策 全部看過一遍 而且是一個一個點喔 每一個link一直點下去 那點到最後你會發現什麼 他們超賊的耶 就是我怎樣都找不到我那個備忘權 到底要如何 我要如何落實 他就是那個link 他就會循環到下一個頁面 跳到一個pdf檔 那pdf檔裡面又一個在link 然後你就再跳到下一個頁面 然後你就是一直跳回一圈之後 你就發現找不到 因為完全沒有申訴的管道 所以呢 就是當我們知道有這些問題 然後當我們知道我們有哪些權利 或者是我們有這些開源的東西可以使用的時候 可是我們真的可以落實嗎 然後我們如何落實 所以就是我想總結來說 就是我希望我們可以促成一些 更親民更接地氣的對話 而不是我們一群可能已經某種程度 享有話語權享有知識權的人 然後來做很飄在天空上的討論 然後就很謝謝大家"

      "comment": "我接下來應該四個都會講到這樣子 剛好在第二輪這樣 25年前有一個宿舍 那個宿舍裡面有一台電腦 電腦上面開了一個open source的某一種功能 這個功能呢 接下來在25年後長成了一個怪物這樣子 這怪物充滿了偏見 全台灣人都知道這個是全台灣最多偏見的地方 他當年剛開始的時候 每一個看板都是有認識的人 或朋友或同系的學生 自己去選板主 不是用選的 就直接指派或直接安插某個人這樣子 直到十年前呢 我們推動了民主化的選板主這件事情 讓最大的板 讓每一個看板都逐漸的 可以自己選自己的板主 自己訂自己的板規 而不是只有站上面的最大的權力 來控制這個全部的每一個看板 所以民主化就在這個階段全面的實施了 就每一個看板可以訂自己的板規 自己的群眾 然後有自己的板主 然後他們可以訂自己的規則 所以實際上是符合最多人擁有最多控制權 因為你不符合這個看板 你就自己出去成立一個新的看板 然後你自己訂自己新的板規 成為新的板主 其實我們也符合Web3 為什麼呢 因為當年確實就是多元宇宙 是大家可以轉信 每個人都可以自己在自己電腦上面 架一個自己的BBS站台 然後可以互相轉信 把自己的信跟自己的文章 轉到另外一個站的另外一個看板裡面 互相直接交換文章 然後把這件事情關掉 現在沒有這樣子的功能 因為很常發生牆壁管轄 就是你在你那個站違反規則的文章 轉來我這個站備份 結果我變成你這個站違反規則的文章的備份站 所以因為法律上面有一些issue 我們難以解決 所以我們暫停了這種Web3的機制 就是我們暫時退一步 先把這個可以自由轉信 變成metaverse的這件事情暫停了 所以實際上也是 就是因為有一些管理上面的限制 所以雖然我們是最大的open source的community 但是我們現在有最多的bios 我說專業跟正確的data這件事情 我必須要說 是有很多人在進電影院要看電影之前 會先上去看一下這個電影的評論好不好 才決定要不要進去這個電影院 那要去國外留學 或者是要考什麼特殊證照的考試 你在哪裡可以找到最多人在討論這個證照 在討論這個出國留學應該要注意什麼樣的內容 這也是群眾力量產生的集體的智慧跟知識 不是有一個獨一的領域的一個中介人 做為最公正的去跟大家說 我就是專業你聽我講 是所有人的集體智慧全部集合起來 大家可以去評論說覺得這篇文章講得很好就給他推 覺得這篇文章講得不好就不給他推 所以這是集體智慧產生出來的結果 我當然不能說全部都是正確或全部都是專業的 但至少他沒有遺漏任何一個人 每一個擁有權限在這個地方發言的人 他都有機會加入自己的意見 當然bios也是一個issue 再來就是所以data的結合 然後還有open source這件事情 我覺得我們現在當然不會把我們的資料 直接就交給AI去training 因為太危險了 另外一件事情就是我們很長期爭論 這個站上面的這些文章究竟是每個人個人的 還是屬於這個站台的 雖然所有人都可以看到這個open的連結 可以去access這個內容 甚至有人寫了爬蟲去每天去爬 然後還產出分析的資料這些事情 但是這資料到底是誰的 然後放在上面誰擁有這個權利 可以去授權別人說你是一個AI 你可以來學我的資料 你可以來看我的資料 什麼時候可以讀 什麼時候可以用 什麼時候可以拿去做分析 這些事情我們目前沒有一個定論 但至少我不會同意這件事情 所以回來講這件事情 我對未來有兩個截然不同的想像 所以我今天有點是來講一個下一個世代的事情 就是有點夢幻的幻想 現在看起來代言模型 你會覺得他有備某些檔案 會吃某些資料 才能回答某些問題 可是如果我們去看那個Q的發展 就是那個open AI 他們下一代想要做的新的AI這件事情 如果當今天一個新的AI的模型 他從原本只是背歐幾里的方程式 變成可以自己先懂歐幾里的方程式 接下來去推黎曼的公式的時候 他從單純的背檔案 到他理解了某件事 可以去推論接下來的新的公式 跟未來的一些 他認為基於這個數學 接下來可以做什麼事情的新的推論的時候 也許我們不需要這麼多資料 也許讓一個有機會自己學習成長的這個AI 他去上網去理解所有人擁有的資料 並且告訴他你什麼時候是可以授權你可以讀 什麼時候是授權你擁有可以背下來 然後直接回答人家 什麼時候你可以 就是要告訴別人說 這個你的資料來源是哪裡 然後要附上正確的網址 並且要公開的宣示說 他是原本有一個真實的活人 他擁有這個人的人格權 或者是內容的制裁權 所以我們現在還是想像可能需要很多資料 然後餵給一個模型 然後讓他學起來 然後接下來他就可以在某一次問答之間 馬上回答出正確答案 但接下來可能不是啊 就是剛才講的 這個模型他已經擁有了某一些 不是只是背答案的這個能力 他接下來有更好的推論能力的時候 他就是一個小朋友 然後他突然學會了上網 那他學會了上網 他接下來會看真實世界資料的內容 然後自己去判斷說 是不是符合某一些價值觀 所以我認為接下來最重要做的事情 是大於模型的民主化 這個民主化要怎麼做呢 他要分層 每一個層級的去讓他民主化 比如說第一層 在訓練跟學習 在製造這個AI的時候 你為什麼資料進去 這件事情放進去 這件事情要民主化 然後他產生出來之後的第二層 不管是AWS講的圍欄 或者是Azure或OpenAI講的 那個內容仲裁 就是你filter的這一層 如何去過濾這個大於模型的BIOS 以及他如何跟人類對齊這件事情 也可以分層結合 就是他可以是分離出去的民主化 這一層的民主化呢 做法就有點像是當初BBS站台 他有很多個看板 每個看板定自己的版規 定自己的規則 然後有一群在這個板上面的人 決定使用這樣子的規則 來進行這個模型的使用跟討論 這樣子就是第二層級的民主化 不只是使用資料訓練 而是當他內容要輸出的時候 他的那個層級可以符合某個區域 某個人權或某個族群的特定的版規 特定的民主化後的區域的輸出內容的過濾 我認為接下來要把每一層 都做到民主化這件事情 首先要先跟大家倡議 就是我想要做這件事情 接下來我要感染更多人 想要做這件事情"

      "comment": "就是我覺得 當然這是個玩笑 最有偏見的東西 現在應該已經被一個更新的東西取代 而且他直接是 disinformation跟misinformation的溫床 就可能不是只是單純bias而已 對 我其實剛剛說上來是想要 因為我是念地理學出身的 所以我對一個東西很在意 所謂的scale就是尺度 然後我剛剛觀察 我自己的感覺 從第一個環節到第二個環節中 有一個很微妙的變化 就是我理解上面藍筆寫的四個問題 包括前一輪第一輪討論問題 其實大部分都跟 有點跟HT剛剛講的 是kernel層級的問題 我們在討論那個語言模型 到底未來人類世界 如果要大量應用這個東西的話 它應該要是什麼 它應該要是有一個至尊無上 還是極用的 還是更弱到不同語言文化的 大家不同的範圍去發展 然後我覺得大部分這裡討論問題 是屬於那個層級 但是因為FC拋出來一個 應用性的問題 在我看來就是 那個應該是應用層面的問題 然後以至於上第二輪 我覺得剛剛前面 蠻多發言的朋友都很精彩 但是就是他有一點 比較是在回應那個應用層次 就是一般人 access AI的那個介面到底怎麼樣 我理不理解AI是什麼東西 或AI跟我的關係是什麼 我覺得核心跟應用 這兩個層級的東西 它一定是有關聯的 可是我們現在要討論 solution的時候 我的想像就是Isabel 如果照原本那個 這裡藍筆寫的問題 她想像她從台灣人工智慧學校 想的那個solution 可能跟我們剛剛講的 其他的東西有一點點隔 因為我會覺得這裡 上一個階段講的 那個屬於kernel 屬於核心的問題 它重要的 最化學來講 它其實是一個治理的問題 就我們需要有一個架構 這到底是一個全球性的架構 還是一個區域性的架構 還是分到每一個國家社會底下的架構 甚至要切得更細嗎 就是這個東西現在是沒有定論 那我們實際上在面對的問題是 包括旁邊的看法 就為什麼那麼快就開始討論說 台灣是不是要發展自己的LM 這個一個前提是 我們先預設有種想像是 有一個我們 我們是台灣 然後所以我們希望有一個 在未來 人工智慧高度應用的環境底下 我們有一個基於我們自己的需求 跟我們對這個東西的價值想法 要去做一個核心 那這個核心可能 它不是世界上唯一的核心 它跟其他的核心之間 又會產生一個關係 然後再往下是 那有了這個核心之後 我們希望在這個 我們的範圍裡面 大家怎麼去應用它 那所以我覺得 其實包括剛剛提到教育的東西 就是都非常好 但就是 就是我覺得 關於核心的公眾溝通 跟關於應用層次的公共溝通 它其實有一點點是 兩個不太一樣的命題 核心的這個層次 我覺得我們可能今天 就大家就比較像是 你是一個台灣公民 然後基於一個共同的東西 我們會發表意見 可是很有可能這個核心的發展 你還是必須交給 就像現在 你會交給你的大醫師 幫你做政策 然後這個政府裡面有很多 實質上去推動發展的單位 他如何去跟民間溝通說 那我們怎麼樣來推動這個東西 所以我覺得核心的問題 以一個公民社會的層次 它比較像是說 我們要怎麼樣去介入這個討論 然後以及在這個過程當中 形成一個我們自己的共識 但這裡一定會出一個問題 就是說核心的東西很難懂 所以某種程度 它也會跟應用那個層次的東西 是發生關聯的 因為絕大多數 以兩千三百萬人來講 絕大多數人的使用 是在應用端的嘛 所以他可能沒有辦法理解 為什麼語言模型還要分不同種 到底差別是什麼 而且核心層級考慮的 所謂的common good 或者social good 它的適用範圍 跟它需要考慮的問題 其實很有可能跟你應用的 跟你在單一個國家社會裡面 要想像的不一樣 比方說剛剛一直提到說 像語言資料輸入這些東西的 你就會馬上想到 對啊 所以在AI時代 這些瀕危的語言 它事實上會變得更弱勢 那我們需不需要有一個超國家的架構 是去保障 就像現在聯合國 有所謂的世界遺產一樣 就是如果你去抬高某些價值 理論上就要有一些治理的作為 要被創造出來 可是那個東西可能是 現在沒有的東西 所以我其實沒有什麼台 但我就是覺得 我們的第二個環節 solution 就因為前面把它展開了 就是這個尺度 有很大的尺度 也有很小的尺度 所以一時之間好像有點難說 但我覺得剛剛家瑋 家瑋的發言非常好 就是他有試圖 把它拉回去到Web3 就是在不同的尺度上 提出了一些小小的解答 我覺得還滿好的"

      "comment": "回應剛剛聽到的東西 就是說未來的那個AI 有沒有自我學習的能力 我覺得是100%的 就是一定會發生的 然後再回應說 我們的台灣的教育 現在有沒有catch up 那個保護自己 還有有沒有知道自己有意識 要去控制自己的資料這個東西 的確是我們落後了其他國家 比如說像歐洲的話 GDPR的教育都一直在落實 然後台灣的話 就是教育部到local的教材 都對個人之間的道德的界線 boundary是有的 但是個人跟數位 digital world的道德的boundary界線 還是很模糊的 所以就是孩子們要意識到說 保護自己的肖像權 他們會覺得我把自己的東西 照片上傳到IG 是一件很OK的事情 可是事實上你要保護你自己 但是我們大人也要再教育自己 剛剛大家提出 最多人有最多的完整政策 如果說把那個最拿掉的話 可能會比較合適一點 因為最他就是most 他就是一個在那個當下的最完美的 but there is no perfect thing 因為如果你要想說 現在這個web 3的演化 它是在演化 所以我們是part of the history 所以這個演化就是非線性的 如果是最的話 它就是會有一個線性的趨勢在成長 你就會看到從最低演到最高點 線性思考非常好 但是如果是非線性的話 現在是這樣 然後下一個又是這樣 就一直在stagnate 所以我們還有另外一個要想的思維 就是not everything is binary 不是二分化 最正確跟不正確 not everything is binary 所以又變成說 大家集結的思考 很棒的就是我們沒有在找對跟錯 善跟惡 都是用非線性的方式去思考的 然後我覺得台灣還是比較習慣top down的management 所以從政府慢慢分散到local的政府 然後各個組織在 每個小組織在自己去 有一個民主化的organic body 有機體 好像是台灣比較習慣的方式 但台灣現在就是 我們有很多的immigration在進來了 我們還要建立很多的道德的那個 不再是一個mandarin漢族為主的國家了 我們現在有太多的外來移民了 我們下一個generation很多人都是混血小孩的 不是只有白人混台灣人而已 我們有太多 因為我自己的環境裡頭 就是有太多多元文化的人在這裡了 然後就變成說我中文不好 我從小在台灣是受教育的 但是我不知道為什麼我長大變成我中文不好 所以說這個environment在變化 不是只有mandarin dominate the society 所以我說這很好 就是沒有binary 然後我們這個演化是non-linearity"

      "comment": "因為我昨天回家的時候不小心就睡著了 然後我本來剛上廁所的時候 我想要修一下這只是我的筆記而已 但是發現那個Gamma沒有辦法在廁所裡面修 所以但今天我講這個的 就是主辦單位請我來講這個的原因 倒不是為了我要怎麼下一頁 都不用我只要下一頁 好都可以這樣其實就可以了 我的目的不是跟大家說web3可以解決這些問題 只是告訴大家說在web3跟AI的對話裡面 有哪些可能性是有被提出來的 所以這些idea可以給大家一些context 是大家在討論什麼 那對於你們來說你們覺得這是不是可能的 所以這個只是一些context的可能性這樣 好謝謝下一個再下一頁 好所以我就是一個一個丟idea出來 again這就是我的筆記 所以大家可以不用看這個筆記只要看title就好了 第一個就是這個可能大家都知道 web3 as provenance 就是你溯源你可以往回到 你可以知道這個content是哪裡來的 因為其實web3跟AI的結合是什麼呢 LM是你沒有辦法去prove LM does not have provable truth 但是web3是什麼 web3是cryptographic truth in a way 所以in a way這兩個其實是perfect marriage if done right 那所以當然比如說像是這個deepfakes或什麼 這些都是有可能你的content從哪裡來 你的content你可以給他hash 是不是從正確的地方來 這些都是web3可以做的事情 那web3也可以是identity也可以是身份 web3可以是那個他們叫人類證明 Proof of humanity不是AI web3可以是Proof of citizenship 你在這些神韻平台我們在參與這個時候 你可以證明你的公民身份 或者是你可以證明你是這個社群的一部分的身份 這些其實都是web3可以去證明的東西 所以這些都是identity的部分 像是像chat gpt的sibyl attack的女巫攻擊 就是你要買很多的帳號 然後去攻擊一個site或攻擊一個什麼 這些在暗網上都可以 已經可以用非常低的價錢去買到了 而且是一個人非常快就可以做到這些事情 所以這個是你要證明自己的身份 或證明自己的內容是從何而來的 這些可能都是web3可以達到的事情 那web3當然剛剛也有人有講到 web3也可以是data ownership web3可以是就是當你把你的data 放到一個LM裡面去的時候 或他在source你的data的時候 他可能可以提供你privacy 他可能可以提供你隱私 在你把data放進去的時候 他不會知道你是誰 那另外一個是當你的data 在這個LM裡面被用的時候 他可不可以把這個reward回到你身上 這個answer again我不知道是是還是不是 但是這個邏輯在整個NFT的世界裡面 在什麼音樂的產業 在什麼art的產業或等等 他一直都是這些providence 因為這個attribution 這些reward要怎麼回到對的人身上 要怎麼回到創作者身上 要怎麼回到這些真的有貢獻的人身上 這個是data ownership的地方 然後再下來web3也是 你在鏈上留下的這些足跡 他也可以是你的reputation 他也可以是你的credibility 你如果去一個我們講很web3的東西 你去一個defi protocol 去一個交易所上面你去借了錢 而且你還了錢 這對你來說就是一個credibility 你可以把這個credibility帶到其他地方 然後你會有一個context說 那你的就是你是一個什麼樣的人 這是可以建立信任的 像有一個app大家也可以去玩一玩 你如果你有wallet的話 叫interface.social 所以你如果follow這個人的錢包的話 就可以看到他所有過去做的事情 他這個which有點可怕 但是這就是他的credibility 這就是他的足跡 那web3也可以是context 就是他們叫contextual confidence 可以是context的provider 那什麼樣的context的provider呢 沒關係這個文字也不用細看 這就是那個 什麼樣的context 比如說你在跟一個medical的AI在互動 你怎麼知道他是 你想要互動的那個medical的LM 還是一個bad intention actor 你怎麼知道他是誰 你怎麼知道這個LM是 coming from the right place 或者是你在讀一篇 跟ftx跟交易所倒閉的相關消息的時候 你怎麼知道這個訊息是從哪裡來的 你能不能有citation 你能不能有reference 你能不能有參考資料 告訴你說這件事情的上下文到底是什麼 因為without context without上下文 我的中英文真的是 沒有上下文這件事情的時候 你的事實是不是事實的 你沒有辦法用正確的觀點去看這件事情 所以web3可能在某種程度上 因為他可以source 所以他也可以提供所謂的context 那再下來是web3 as data sources 他可不可以是 就是你的LM的data 可不可以是verifiable data 然後再輸入這個LM 然後這個LM再產出結果 理論上是如果對的資料輸入 那對的結果就會出來 就是這個我也不是很確定 但這個可能是web3可以做到事 那當然這個回過頭來 這個問題是什麼呢 你怎麼能夠scalable去蒐集verifiable data 這個規模化的大量的蒐集 真實的資訊這件事情到底要怎麼來 怎麼樣才能做到這件事情 所以這當然也是一個問題 那當然這個data source 他可以transparent 他可以透明 也可以追溯 也可以audit 所以這些東西都是 如果你要base一個 也許是一個小型的模型 或者是一個非常specific scenario的模型 那如果他的data source 都是verifiable data的話 那比較有可能可以 讓這個真相可以變成是那個 那當然比如說像是 我們現在像CAPTCHA這樣的東西 已經不work了 你完全可以跳過像CAPTCHA這樣的東西 那對於一個想要登入 想要對一個平台 平台想要知道來的人到底都是誰 是不是human beings 是不是members 他可不可以用web3的方法 去有這樣的一個可以信任的experience 或可以信任的interface 那再下來就當然 這個大家可能也熟悉 大部分是centralized training centralized deployment 那LAMA是centralized training decentralized deployment 那你如果要做decentralized training decentralized deployment的話 decentralized training要怎麼做 因為要require很多的資源嘛 那web3有一個很強項是什麼 是募資 crowdfunding 你要怎麼用token 你要怎麼用這些 已經證明 就是在過去已經證明說 有很多成功募資案例的時候 然後在這個地方 可以scalable的去募到資金 讓全球可以參與 然後來做一個 decentralized training model 這也是一個可能性 那web3當然也可以是一個security layer 這個security layer 為什麼web3可以是security layer呢 原因呢 是因為web3非常常被hack 就去年2022的時候 有一個最大hack 叫ronin network ronin network 他因為他的 好像是跨鏈橋還是什麼被hack 他去了640 million dollars 這是one hack 那這只是其中的一個case 當然是最大的其中一個case 可是擁有在其他 在這個產業裡面 擁有其他的 就是同樣資本的 這些protocols 他其他 如果他沒有被hack的話 那就代表說這個產業 慢慢在build 這security wise的韌性 那就是good engineering good product engineering 就他只有一句話 滿有趣的 good engineering involves how things can be made to work the security mindset involves thinking how things can be made to fail 所以像這樣的 這個security mindset 可能是在web3的世界 可能是有 那你有了一個好的 secure的foundation 你才能有AI safety without a secure foundation there would be no AI safety 那web3當然也可以是一個 alignment的mechanism 我的理解是 AI safety via debate 這件事情是 兩個AI就是 大家應該理解 但是兩個AI 彼此去吵架 然後由人類去judge 那個誰是對的嗎 但是這個問題是 兩個AI也有可能collude 也有可能共謀 在這個共謀的情況下 對於人類來說 因為web3很常在 處理的一件事 就是anti-collusion 或anti-symbol attack 所以像這樣的一些資訊 像這樣的一些技術 像這樣的一些機制 也有可能可以apply 在這樣的東西上面 對不起 剛剛還有一件事情是 因為我們其實已經知道 像這個 我們可以plant 一些undetectable backdoors 在machine learning models裡面 但是這些undetectable backdoors 可不可以 就是轉換一個想法 用來去box這個AI 讓它沒有辦法去做 我們不希望它去做的事情 這也是有可能 那這個回過頭來 也跟web3在做 cryptography的時候 可能是有一些關係的 那最後當然coordination 就是上次跟Vienna 跟Isabel 跟OpenAI人有一個討論 那在討論的時候 我們就碰到一個人叫Ryan 那這個Ryan 他現在在OpenAI裡面 做的事情 其實就是 怎麼收集全球大家的資訊 大家的想法 然後去告訴他說 AI應該怎麼走 那他是有點像是 就是一個ethical department of OpenAI something like that 但是這個問題是 他的這個department 在坐在他的decision making table 這個的時候 他就算把所有的證據 他有辦法去做這個decision嗎 所有的人 會聽他去講這個decision嗎 I don't know That's the decision making model That's the kind of governance coordination kind of mechanisms that we probably can look deeper into 然後看看web3在這個方面 有沒有辦法幫到任何人 I don't know 所以這是一個可能 web3可不可以decentralize AGI I don't think so 但是對這題我們跳過好了 應該是 然後這個 我給大家一個web3 現在在討論跟AI相關的 比較大的一個主題 叫chain link 不是比較大的一個項目 叫chain link chain link想要去build東西 叫做verifiable web 下一個 所以他的problem statement 當然就是跟其他一樣 就是所有的金融產業 他因為這些金融產品 讓大家弄得摸不著頭腦 他有很多hidden information 他有很多hidden mechanism hidden agenda 讓大家沒有辦法去follow up However 就是這個same thing with the news media and all that 下一張 所以chain link的回答 我等一下會講清楚一點 但其實就是 我先跟大家講一下 chain link是做什麼 chain link以前叫做oracle oracle protocol就是truth provider 他的truth是像什麼樣的東西 比如說像是 巴黎的天氣怎麼樣 今天巴黎幾度 或者是bitcoin今天的price是什麼 所以他擁有了這些truth之後 你就可以對bitcoin這個東西 去做futures 去做options 去做whatever 所以他們是這樣的 所謂的truth provider 他在蒐集這些bitcoin prices的時候 他可能不會只找一個source 他可能會找最大的交易所的幾個source 然後去compare 然後去決定說這個truth是什麼 然後把這個truth feed到需要這個真相的人身上 但chain link的answer就是 combine blockchain networks combine oracle networks 然後去build 所謂的verifiable applications 讓真相可以在這整個流程中發生 那接下來我來告訴大家一下 他是想要怎麼去做這件事 這個圖有一點點小 但是他其實是三件事 他其實是三件事 就是verifiable data verifiable computation 跟verifiable connections 只有這三件事情 在資料來源 在計算 在connection 三個都是verifiable的時候 你的真相才有可能真的被deliver 你不管中間任何一條線 如果被砍斷 或者是他不是fully verifiable的話 那他都有可能在中間被pollute 所以他的 其實chain link是一個提供一個服務 所以你可以想像說 他在verifiable data的時候 如果是 比如說像紐約時報 紐約時報他會把他的 這些stories 紐約時報所謂的真相 去input inject到這個data layer裡面 這data layer可能會上鏈 讓他是沒有辦法被tamper 沒有辦法被 加工 或者是修改 或者是 whatever thank you 然後 第二個是computation 所以他在這邊叫chain link function chain link function有一個 他叫computation market 其實就是把這些LM 用一個市場機制 去買這些LM的算力 然後來幫他做中間的computation 那最後 在有verifiable connections 能夠真實的把這個 對的資訊或compute 結束的資訊 不管是不是LM deliver到user的手上 那他們在講的是這三步 那當然他還有很多 更複雜的機制 不過主要他們現在做的事情 是這樣 那下面那個就不講了 但這個是 至少在web industry 針對AI可能創造disinformation 或什麼這些事情 現在最直接 看起來最完整的一個解法 我的部分大概就這樣 簡單來說就是 我也 這些東西也都是只是想法 想像跟 當然有些是solution 可是只是給大家一些點子 說看怎麼可以圍繞這些東西 去討論說 這些東西合不合理 值不值得想像 那他真正解決問題 是不是應該要解決問題 等等 我這邊就這樣 Noah do you wanna take some questions? 你要讓大家來提問嗎? 好啊 大家有沒有什麼問題 想要問一下Noah 一片靜默 有啦 我剛剛看到很多人一直在點頭 就是有在想 就是想問一下 如果要使用web3 來當作是AI的基礎建設的話 是不是也代表著說 就是參與這樣子過程的 就是所有的參與者 都必須要有web3相關的知識 那這樣子的話 有沒有 它對於整個AI基礎建設的多元性 真的會帶來正面的影響嗎? 我覺得一個是 你說的是像比如說 使用者的金融門檻 像這樣的 我覺得比如說像錢包這種東西 都慢慢在 門檻都慢慢在降低 那比如說在crypto裡面 現在有些技術叫什麼 account abstraction 或什麼 其實它都慢慢變成是一個 更像是web2的experience 而不是web3的experience 當然它中間可能會 一開始會有一些比較多的妥協 但是慢慢的應該是往那個方向走 所以 如果在使用者體驗上面的那個gap 是越來越少的話 那對使用者來說 應該不是一個問題 那如果說像是剛剛的 比如說像chainlink的那個solution的話 它其實並不會碰到使用者端 它就是 它provide truth的方法 讓這些new york times 或financial institution 讓所有人可以 其實第一個是這樣 第一個是你如果進去看它機制的話 你可以完全知道 它機制是怎麼work的 那第二個是 如果它機制有改變的話 所有人都會在同一個時間點 去知道說改變了什麼 那第三個是 如果你決定要走的話 你也可以take your values and leave 因為像比如說ftx的問題 就是你知道它發生問題了 但是你沒有辦法把東西給拿出來 所以它ensure這三件事情是可以成形的 但是我們去看的時候看不懂 它要怎麼讓我們看得懂 有沒有AI的processors 可以讓我們更加看得懂 I don't know 就是這個都是值得待解的問題 那supposedly那個進入門檻 應該是會越來越低才對 好 那就這樣囉"

      "comment": "剛剛有人有提到說 關於這BBS是一個most biased的一個 已經變成一個most biased的place 一種情況 然後他提到一個很棒的一個點 是說民主化的輸入跟輸出都是很重要的 你要能夠知道 有一群人能夠共同決定說 在我們這個圈子裡面 可能我們允許怎麼樣的資訊跟怎麼樣的computation 我們可以把交流也當成一個computation 然後同時也要有另外一個機制是 你輸出這個computation結果輸出之後 其他人也能夠自己去決定 另外一個group去決定說 我要不要接受這個computation 我個人認為這邊他提到一個很重要的一點 就是你是用group而不是個人 我先講一個另外一個故事 在30年前曾經有一群人 他們認為說世界上大多數的政治權利 軍事權利跟經濟權利都被少數的人壟斷 是非常糟糕的事情 世界上絕大多數的人都沒有任何好的能夠工作的機會 能夠參與機會能夠晉升的機會 所以我們應該要盡量的把這個東西decentralize掉 然後盡量的把金融門檻盡量降低 讓所有的資源能夠盡量平均的分散到整個世界 他們不斷的去降低這個門檻 甚至設立了兩個等一下我大概會講出他們的名字的 重要的全球性重要機構 去幫助這件事的發生 隔了十年之後 世界上出現了各式各樣的工作不穩定的勞工 然後出現各式各樣國際性的問題 然後有錢人變得更有錢 這件事情叫做globalization 然後那兩個組織叫做IMF跟World Bank 那為什麼會發生這樣的事情呢 是因為我們平常在 沒錯民主化是非常重要 但是它的其中的institution跟 大家前面有人講到 我們要培育一個參與的過程 無論是training的過程參與的過程 尤其是參與治理的過程 因為治理跟功能或者是治理跟效益 其實很多時候是衝突的 對 因為剛剛前面也有做政治學的朋友提到 有一個概念可能在 通常是不容易提到的是 大家知道其實就是那種 就是完全小政府的主義 守一個人政府的思維 跟共產主義其實想法是一樣的 他們希望我們是完全decentralized 所有的每一個人他以個人的身分 或是個別公司的身分 去自我決定我要接受怎麼樣的資料 我要接受怎麼樣的 因為資料可以是物理的資料 可以是數據的資料 我們要盡什麼樣的權利 我們要自由跟誰交往 我們不要任何的institution 尤其我們絕對不要有centralized的東西去管控一切 他們只是用兩種方式去進行 一種方式是說我要進行一個暫時性的集中革命 那個東西叫共產主義 一種方式是把所有看到集中的東西全部拆掉 那個東西叫做守一個人政府 可是我們後來就看到 這兩種東西就產生很大的問題 那所以為什麼他們會這樣想 他們想的是功能 就是說我任何一個smart contract 如果用web suite的方法來講 或者是一個AI的方法來講 我任何一個smart contract 我任何一個AI 是不是能夠滿足我個體 我作為一個消費者 終端使用者而言 而不是參與者而言的需求 他們是用這個角度去想的 而不是我不光只是一個雙方消費者 我同時成為一個參與治理 成為一個參與組織的人 但是組織一定是有成分 所以很多時候你今天要能夠讓一個 真正保持民主化而不是進入 剛剛講到的無論說是globalization 還是共產主義還是守一個人政府的情況之下 有時候你必須犧牲一點效率 你看待大家如何的民主化治理 民主化training AI的過程 可能要變成某種意義上的組織起來 甚至你必須要接受到次好的結果 然後讓這個一個有邊界的東西 有組織性的東西 它有不斷的iteration的空間"

      "comment": "然後我說那個它歷史發展來講 我就對比一下AI 就是器官鏈發展的時候 它就是因為一些那個人 他覺得受到了美國比如NASA 或者安全局的一些迫害 然後他想發明一個東西 就是說我能不受到這些人的控制 然後他就在嘗試說 我的裡面是不是可以衍生出 就是我可以自己所控制的資產和這種數據 那當時他面對的可能就是 比如說類似美國國家安全局 這種加密學的一種追蹤能力 那今天比如說有可能 我們說AI公司它可能並不是這樣的一個結構 但依然是另一個叫強勢中心或者強力中心 就是它可能是擁有一個海量用戶 並且它是有非常高的生產能力 然後它這樣一個能力的背後 代表它是一個非常強大的中心 而這種強大的中心背後 它的影射成為就是一個 它是超過普通意義上的這種 商業大型公司的這種 更巨大的一個強力中心 那面臨的問題 我覺得Web3歷史上 它有什麼解法來解這個問題 是不是在面臨這麼一個 更巨大的強力中心 或者說它有什麼解決的思路 我覺得有一個東西就是 區塊鏈的發展它裡面有 核心幾個就是社會性的需求 這種社會需求包括就是 剛才說的區域中心化 抗審查還有隱私性 那這三點來講 它會構建出一些能力 剛才Laurel也分別說出來了 然後我覺得比如說在 區塊鏈還有很多問題沒有解決 比如說它面臨的一個更複雜的問題 就是當前美國這個叫 Africa就是美國反洗錢中心 就是想全面揭露 以太坊和相關的DeFi的生態 目前的情況應該不樂觀 就是從上個月 包括美國訴告了弊案以後 然後應該是絕大部分的DeFi的項目 也都揭露了Office AC 還有Finance Center 就是美國司法部 金融反洗錢法司法局 這樣的話其實這個局 依然沒有破 那以太坊就是說 那我是不是可以更改進底層協議 就是比特幣的共識叫POW 靠礦機挖礦的共識 靠礦產的共識 那以太坊靠POS 靠於抵押你的以太坊的共識 那我們在現實生活中 我們的共識有可能靠投票 和靠你的經濟生產活動的共識 那它可能想更加的 從POS這個協議上更底層 可以讓這種美國包括Office AC 就是可以沒有能力去控制它 那我們從這個歷史的發展思考 可以思考一些問題 就是我們如果通過Web3來解決 更強大的一個生產力中心 就是比如說AI這種公司來講 那有什麼東西我們可以解決的 比如說有一些顯性的能力 我覺得是可以就是 在這裡面可以進來的發生的 比如說我覺得 未來的七塊鏈可能會發生一個事情 因為在那個蘇州世界上 沒有聯合國的 那現在中國可能還有北約 還有聯合國什麼的 還有包括現在發行的AI 這個無人機攻擊武器 都是很強大的 那這種情況下 就是在蘇州世界裡面 這種沒有聯合國政府 但是可能更需要我們更多的 就是叫它有一個東西 叫人類的這個叫 剛才說了就是叫協調機制 所以它把 就是七塊鏈現在基本上 把人類社會上 共同的曾經用過的一人一票法 還是說現在那個叫平方叉法 還是包括公民投票法 所有的人類的裡面產生過的 協調的投票的法 它都形成了規則 這是七塊鏈很厲害的地方 就是還有包括這種 我們使用的公共財的資金 還有這種我們應該 哪些錢應該用到哪個地方 它都產生了很多機制 比如說我們知道哈佛稅 是吧 這種很多它嘗試過 在不斷的設計 更好的機制 這個機制可以用代碼化 而且人可以抵押出 你想證明的你的資產 或者你的信譽 或者說你證明你是一個個體 去參與這裡面的協調 那我想表達的什麼意思 就是我覺得有可能 比如說以太坊為例 會產生出一種 總是有很多人 有些人可能會作惡 那我們可能每個人 都有自己的黑名單 我們可能有 我們都會拉黑一些人 那這種黑名單 它可能是說 它可能會建立一種 就是黑名單庫 而這黑名單庫是一個 去中心化機制的 形成的黑名單庫 而這個庫不一定是說 就是靠美國制定的 OFAC制裁的這種 它指定的這些庫 那我覺得有可能 以太坊就會形成這樣的 黑名單的規則 或者說很重要的一些規則 而這些規則就是未來 有可能在協調AI的這種 剛才大家提到的數據問題 很多問題 這些規則就未來有可能是 可以以太坊 包括器官鏈有非常大的協調能力 它是可以來協調AI 因為現在的AI 它有可能是目前來看 它的人才庫主要是在 這個美歐中 美國歐中和中國 大概就這三個人才庫 大概率它也是為國家所用 因為人才庫大部分轉彎 在國家手上 那這樣的話 就會存在一個特點 那誰來協調這些國家呢 那沒有人能協調了的 那我覺得數字世界裡面 如果AI是一個 數字化模型 並且是一個工程式的 一個可編程的程序的話 那我覺得器官鏈會不斷地探索這種 你們現實生活中 可能無法協調的事情 那我們在 今天在我們的數位世界裡面 是不是可以協調 目前看起來一直很困難 但是Web3一直在這個領域 不斷地探索 我個人還是覺得還挺樂觀的 好 謝謝"

      "comment": "我的想法結論就是 我認為我們在討論 Web3如何解決AI的時候 不要只討論區塊鏈 意思就是說 Web3不只是Crypto 它可以是Cryptography 它可以是任何 跟加密學有關的任何工具 因為Web3的精神 是一個分散式的技術 比如說上上一位發言的朋友 他剛剛講的概念 其實就是一個很經典的資料合作社 或者是資料公司 我因為不知道我的資料 要怎麼樣授權 所以有一個第三方 來幫助我去把關 我的資料被誰盜了 或者是怎麼去賣給其他人 那當然在 在這個自由的市場 叫做資料公司 在相對社會民族主義的市場 叫做資料合作社 那當然也有國家幫你管 那個零到一百歲國家養 資料國家養 這種可能就是個人資料保護委員會 這樣子的做法 那沒有人知道這個方向會怎麼走 原因是因為個人資料的自主權 或者是個人身份的自主權 到現在都還不是一個 天賦人權的人權 我們今天如果生活在十九世紀 我們可能還不知道 原來投票是一種人權 那在數位人權其實也是一樣的概念 雖然現在已經有很多的數位人權憲章 或者是相關的宣言 可是人還是不知道 原來自己的個人資料 是應該被保護的 它不是一種基本權利 我是說在現在這個世界 可是二三十年後 我們的 我們可能還在 或者是我們的下一代 那種資料原住民 他們可能會更重視自己的這些資料 相關的工具可能會更加的 具有這種保護的效果 這種工具不一定只是技術工具 它有可能是制度面的 文化面 社會規範面的東西 那這樣子的概念有沒有在發展 其實發展的非常多元 我舉個例子就好 像是Solid Protocol 它是另外一種Web 3.0 那個Tim Berners-Lee在搞的東西 它就是意思就是說 他們發展了一個一個Pod 每個Pod都是一個保險庫 這個保險庫裡面 可以放所有個人的資料 包含這個社群網站的發言 或者是身分證等等的 但是只有你同意的時候 臉書才可以去取用你的這個Pod 這個Pod是被自己管的 那想當然了 這樣的東西在現在這個社會 政府有興趣 私人公司發展怎麼樣都發展不出來 因為它不是一個被規範性的事情 這是其中一個案例 當然在鏈上也有非常多 類似這樣子的案例 像是今天這個Sugi演講 她的Mask Network 也做了很多這樣子的概念 那更不用說DID這種去中心身分 可驗證的憑證VC等等的 但是我想要強調的是 大家不要想說 有了區塊鏈我們就可以溯源 不是這樣子 因為區塊鏈是一個分散式的技術 所以我們很容易就想說 區塊鏈可以驗證 那是不是所有人就可以來驗證了呢 那它又變成了一種中心化的 想像中的解決方案 但是誰要去相信這個憑證 其實還是需要非常多層層的組織 這個世界權力的競合 才會產生出來的一個世界 所以這樣子個人資料自主 或者是個人身分自主的世界 如何達成 其實還是很困難的 那剛剛Noah在分享的投影片裡面 有一個概念我想要把它拿出來延伸 叫做Contextual Confidence 中文沒有官方翻譯 但我會把它翻譯成脈絡的信心 它其實是一篇論文 出來一個Huffle的Getting Priority Network 去講的一篇論文 Shrey Jam寫的 叫做Contextual Confidence 它的概念很簡單 就是在講說 我們AI合成圖片 合成文字出來的時候 我們很難去知道 這個文字本身是真的還是假的 我們也沒有必要去判斷 它是真的還是假的 我們可以從這個文字出來 跟它的目的去判斷 它的脈絡是不是我們能夠相信的 所以它叫做Contextual 它叫做脈絡式的信心 那它提出了一個四個象限 有很多很多的解法 這些解法其實不只是 區塊鏈的工具來做解決 它的解法是這樣子的 它分成遏止策略跟動員策略 遏止是相對被動的 被動的意思就是 我們加個浮水印 我們加個溯源的憑證 我們用Community Note Twitter的Community Note 大家在那邊留言 去遏止這個東西 這個脈絡 我們去Check它的脈絡 那動員的策略就是 更加積極的去防護它 剛剛被動的可能是 我經由一個政府發行的身分來講話 那我就不是假帳號 這是一個被動的方式 那主動的方式是 我們很費力的去說 這件事情可能不是真的 因為它不在我們社群的脈絡裡面 它是外來者 這是主動的 這是其中左邊跟右邊的象限 那另外一邊的象限是指說 我們要先辨識 我們才能夠保護 所以我們如何辨識資料是合成的 不管影音還是文字是合成的 它有一套邏輯 誰發的 發的過程中 有沒有數位浮水印等等的 才能夠知道它是不是合成的 那我們知道它是否為合成以後 才有辦法去保護 不管是合成的資料 還是非合成的資料 所以在講Contextual Confidence的過程 我覺得是非常高妙的 作者很高明 雖然它是一個學術的論文 他講的是 他根本不去Care 這個文本本身是不是AI生成的 他Care的是這個內容從何而來 那它的效應影響了誰 誰應該去保護它 那當然它分了非常多層 包含政府的 公司的 非營利組織的 資料合作社其實也在這個 剛剛它的框架裡面 資料合作社在 它是一個動員策略 因為畢竟我們要主動去保護自己的資料 那是在 它不在辨識的這個層次 它在後續保護的層次 所以是一個主動保護的一塊 對 所以講了這麼多 我想要強調的事情是 當我們在討論Web 3如何去解決問題的時候 不妨退一步來看 它不一定是一個區塊鏈的解決方式 而是一個更加範疇更廣的 去中心分散式的技術 或是文化或制度的解決方式這樣子"

      "comment": "就是剛剛這一位 還有大家之前講的 還有今天早上麗穎講的 我覺得 我們可能要在這樣的討論裡面 是要看看 是不是大家都有跟上 我指的大家都有跟上 並不是只有在我們這個場域裡面 像我在舉辦這一個 就是assembly 或審議討論的時候 對我來說非常困難的一件事 就是我到底要邀請什麼樣的人參加 就是我們在第一場討論裡面 確實就是我們有 大概一半的名額是對 就是完全開放的 那完全開放的結果就是說 其實大家的對背景知識的 理解的落差 其實是相當大的 那它就會影響到 你在審議過程中 會有一些 就是時間這個資源的消耗 因為它可能同時在討論 但是同時又要去解釋 那些背景知識 但這個是沒有辦法 我覺得這個是 一定要嘗試你才知道會這樣 那另外就是說 我覺得我們有沒有跟上 剛剛您舉了一個非常好的例子 就是老人家的例子 那老人家的這例子呢 就是我覺得在現在我們的擔憂裡面 也許有一百件一千件 但是到底哪些是最急的 其實必須要有一個優先順序 然後最急的那件事情 也許有現在暫時的解方 也有長期性的解方 那你現在不暫時先去 做一些處理的話 它的損害擴大可能是 後面沒有辦法收拾的 這有點像 我常常覺得我們現在 坐在一艘船上面 那航向未知的大海 你的資源 船上的物料是有限 資源是有限的 那你在航行的途中 其實你要想辦法 把這艘船再改造成一個 更先進的船 可能是木頭船 要轉成動力船之類 那可能中間有破洞 到處都是破洞 那你要不要先把這些破洞堵起來 這些破洞在哪裡 會影響到你願意花多少 就是現有的資源 去處理這件事情 那我覺得這就是 非常困難的各種事 那我之所以要講說是未知的事 我其實並不認為 我真心並不認為 我們現在有所謂的專家 就是有些人對某些部分 理解的比較多 有些人就是不同的領域 理解的個別的比較多 所以我們需要很多討論 去彙整 然後才有辦法去理解 我們現在真正面對的問題 還有甚至排除那個優先順序 因為那個優先順序 牽涉到價值的問題 牽涉到價值取捨的問題 那就是 所以我覺得 其實要讓大家來參與 其實是非常困難的一件事 我必須要說這件事是 我們在舉辦這些活動的時候 我也到國外去分享 我自己的這些經驗 對外國人來說非常驚訝 是你們的參與程度這麼高 而且我們沒有付錢給各位 這個非常非常困難 因為META他們在辦的時候 他們是付錢的 而且每個人都拿到非常多錢 希望下次不要大家來 對 謝謝 所以我真的要非常感謝大家 那韓國的教授就跟我說 他覺得台灣人非常有Civic Mind 就是公民參與的精神 那我覺得這個是我們這邊 最寶貴的經驗和資源 那我其實就非常希望 我們可以再協助 把這些討論弄得更好一點 好 我先分享到這裡"

      "comment": "就是我的想法的總結這樣子 因為就是從第二個部分 大家的解法那邊 其實前面原本題目是寫wave3 但是其實大家是想得很廣的 就是用各種解法去想 那其實也回應到剛豆尼講的 就是wave3可以解決嗎 是不行嗎 因為需要從各個方面 所以我就是把各個方面的關係 把它寫出來 我覺得這邊是政府 太久沒寫字 然後這個是bit tag 然後它可能是跟AI有關的 然後接下來就是人群 然後人群其實就是 一部分就是我們這群人 就是會去關心的這群人 但是就是小群人 但是其實大部分的人是不關心的 他們是過得好就好 然後有好的工具 讓他生活過得更好就好 那其實我剛剛就在想說 這個關係我就覺得 就很像進擊的巨人 因為我就在想 我們這群小小的人就是進擊的巨人 有太深入了 就是這群小小的人 就是不斷地追求自由 對啊 所以就是進擊的巨人 那這一群人就是純潔巨人 就是受到bit tag 這邊是始祖巨人 然後這邊是九大巨人 就是最有power的 然後接著他們就是可以控制 控制純潔巨人們 所以我就想到這個關聯性 然後其實剛剛有講到 wave3的解法 我覺得都比較是處於這邊的關係 就是可能是一些分配 怎麼去從這個bit tag這邊分配到 不管是分配到利益 或者是到擁有權 或是什麼東西的 就是比較是處理這邊的關係 可是剛剛其實大家講到的很多的 不管是教育 教育可能是從這邊去倡議政府 然後政府再去 再往這邊下來這樣子 或者是我們這邊的人 直接去用其他的分散式的方式 去做教育這樣子 對 這剛剛有講到 那或者是從這邊上來 然後也是去倡議 然後再去進行監管 對 就是這樣子的關係 然後這邊做的事情其實很多 就是要把更多的純潔巨人 變成晉級的巨人這樣子 對 然後其實回應到剛剛那個 有講到的open source跟closed 其實就是那個 應該說必源的也是必要的 因為九大巨人擁有的力量很大 所以它其實是 推進發展是蠻重要的 不可能全部人都是分散的這樣子 所以其實就 這邊只是補充 就是一部分人 他們就會變成九大巨人這樣子 對 那這邊是我把這個關係畫出來 就是我覺得 可以就是剛剛吸收大家的東西 然後就有這個想像這樣子 我覺得很好可以去理解說 我們剛剛講的 web3的解法的部分 或者是其他的 透過教育啊 或者是透過一些其他的方式 去解決這個問題這樣子 對 謝謝大家"

      "comment": "其實如果 因為叔叔不在這邊 我覺得如果是像叔叔這種 做這種合作社經紀的 他可能會有另外的想法 因為我們教育可能覺得說 在學校或是說在政府 但是其實最痛的教育 就是在企業 因為其實大家沒有時間 來了解這些web3 很大一部分 你放眼整個社會 就是工作生活壓力非常大 然後你在企業裡面 你下了班 你要去投票嗎 好累喔 我就睡覺吧 就是太累了 然後再來就是 如果在一個企業裡面 就是說關乎你生計的 這樣的一個組織 你已經在裡面 是習慣相對民主的決議的話 如果是一個合作社或一個什麼 那其實我們就不是說 工作是工作 教育是教育 然後教育是政府 教育在學校 如果你的工作現場本身 它的性質就已經是相對民主的 那就是最直接的教育 然後如果你在工作場域 你因為這樣子 你有更多的餘裕 更多的時間 你工作的方面 我指的是他的 不管是生產力或是什麼 都處理好之後 其實你有更多自己的時間 你才有可能管這些事情 因為我們剛才不斷地回溯 一個問題就是說 怎麼樣讓大家 越來越多人來用 但問題這就是 我覺得按照比較左派的方法 他會覺得教育是比較唯心主義 你要回到唯物的層次 就是工廠 企業 你上班場域的那一個民主的決策 他貫徹到什麼程度 其實坦白講就是經濟民主 蘇珠沒有來 我來這邊偷偷幫他代言一下 這樣子"

      "comment": "就是那個廟口要來說服我的 我想分享的是 其實在台灣有兩個大災難 一個是九二一 一個是莫拉克 在非常快速的救援的步調之下 有災區發出的聲音叫做 慢慢來比較快 為什麼 因為你們都不來問我們 你們都不來跟我們討論 然後你們幫我們決定了ABCD 結果我流離失所 結果你把所有靠土地才能活下去的人 全部遷到一個沒有農地的地方 他們完全不知道怎麼往下活 是因為壞心嗎 不是 因為溝通不夠 我想溝通其實是非常難的 然後它需要花時間 我們沒有辦法在 剛剛提到有些人真的是很疲勞 他其實沒有時間沒有空間 來關注或者來聽你說什麼 但是一定還有很多人他是關心的 他只是不知道他從何開始 然後我舉個例子來說 我覺得我們要接觸的是那一群 像很多身障朋友他們現在都有個口號 Nothing about me without me 沒有我參與不要替我做決定 那台灣其實有很多這樣的人在不同的角落 所以我們要接觸的是他們 我們是要跟那個比較有準備的人對話 這個是第一個大方向 第二個是很多非營利組織的夥伴跟我說 最近只要去參加活動都在被恐嚇 恐嚇你們沒有投資資安 這樣以後會有刑責 這種恐嚇其實常常讓他們不知道怎麼辦 就會陷入比較panic 就是反而慢 讓他的反應變慢 那我要說的是我們在談AI 我們在談web 3一樣 請不要只記得恐嚇跟威脅 因為我聽了之後我就想我離他遠一點比較好 我老人家會想說我不要管他 等別人管 所以我是覺得這也是我們在論述上面 我們可能可以再努力的 因為這些東西為什麼是我們這麼用力 你們要去當禁止技人的 為什麼要這麼用力 他吸引你的是什麼 一定不是我不要什麼 而是我想往哪裡前進 我想往哪裡前進的那個圖像 可能我們要更有能力去描述它 以上"

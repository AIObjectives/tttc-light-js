          <h2>About</h2>

          <Outline />
          <p>
            Talk to the City (T3C) helps large groups of people coordinate by
            understanding each other better.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an open-source tool for public consultation that solves the
            trade-off between depth and scale, using LLMs for comprehensive
            analysis of large response data. Whether you're soliciting general
            feedback from thousands of constituents, or untangling subtle
            details of a complex concern, T3C preserves the nuance of individual
            views while making sense of the collective conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previous versions of Talk to the City have been used by the
            Taiwanese government and the Taiwan AI Assembly, unions, policy

            We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze broad themes from
            large datasets of free-text responses, summarize specific claims,
            and link those claims back to exact quotes. We use LLMs from OpenAI
            (default: gpt-4o-mini), and are adding more options later this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            We create an interactive report from the results, combining all
            scales of analysis, stored for you on the talktothe.city site. See

            This alpha version of T3C accepts input of any unstructured text,

            experimental features to process audio and video datasets, and
            include video in reports &ndash; reach out if you're interested in
            using these features while they're under development.

    “Ten years ago, the vTaiwan scope was limited, because stakeholder groups
    needed to adapt to the technology at the time. Today, this is being bridged
    with the advent of language models that can adapt to their needs. Back in
    2014, it was impossible with the capacity of g0v contributors to interview a
    mini public of people and aggregate their ideas while preserving the full
    nuance. But now, with Talk to the City's help, that cost has been reduced to
    essentially zero. It's broad-listening and it can change the nature of this
    recursive public.”

    “Given the vast amount of qualitative data we collected, Talk to the City's
    analysis was crucial in identifying gender-specific challenges in the lives
    of young Australian women and men. This analysis helped us craft our policy
    recommendations, focusing on the experiences of marginalised demographics.
    Having the data organised under specific themes, then being able to go
    through the interviewees actual statements, was powerful.”

    initiative for improving the life outcomes of Australian women

Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:00:00," . Hi, my name is Kimberly Woodson and I am a 53 year old mother of a five year old and a 35 year old.  And my biggest concern as a Detroiter is the gentrification that's going on. Like I can't ride down three blocks and it's now all of a sudden suburbanized and. It's little bitty kids that can play differently in a cleaner street and a different environment. And I feel like what happens to my little brown baby in the future, because I know as a youth growing up in Detroit, I wasn't heard.  It was like there was no protection for women and girls then, and it seemed to be no protection for women and girls now, like we just buried this baby all because her mother no longer wanted to be with a man in 2020. I had to bury my sister. Because she no longer wanted to be with her husband. It's an epidemic going on in society, and because most of the victims happen to be black and brown, it is not.  , don't get me wrong, I am forever grateful that during Covid 19, that man's life was lost, and the response to the death. I will ever be grateful for all the people, like the Black Lives Matter, everything that grew out of that one death.  It was like his name, a flood of . All these righteous, wonderful gifts",0
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:01:38," Women, where is our righteous indignity? They lock up mothers. And when you lock up a mom, you destroy a community. When you lock up a dad, you don't need to destroy a household. So it's like where is the protection for the women that are incarcerated are, are there because of direct action of a man or a dominant co-defendant who was forcing things on them.  My fear is do I flee Detroit or Michigan because they don't see my baby? I. And they would never see her. Or do I stand and scream and shout and keep doing everything I feel is right, not for just myself and my daughter, but for my community. Do I still keep fighting to heal my community or do I throw in a towel and say, they're never gonna make me feel safe in Detroit because I'm not light enough.  Because I'm not the right ethnicity, you know what I'm saying? So it's like the same things can happen to the black and brown women for forever. And the first time it happens to someone of another race, then all hell loose. And that's not fair. And this is my city and it's been predominantly black most of my 53 years.  I'm sure it's been that way longer than that. So why is it that my resources, my cops, Can't come to my city block in a hurry like they do in all of the nice neighborhoods that they have now done since I've been home 2017. And when I first came home, I was devastated of my city, but now I see some improvement.  I love the idea of the walk and the bike ride to be able to go from one city all the way downtown to the river walk. I love to show off the best of my city, but there is parts and nooks and nannies of the family of the city that the mayor and everybody else don't want people to see and know about.  They need love too, and those are the spots that I care about the most. Those are the parts I do care about how my child is being educated in the Detroit public schools and their ratings. I do care about how people can want returning citizens to go show up to a Scared Straight thing to improve, prove they already feel bad, teenager or kids that's on a negative path behavior, but yet cannot allow a parent to volunteer and help.  Actually infiltrate and make sure that those children aren't making the same mistake that they made. So it's like you don't hear the little African American girl, you silence her everywhere you can. You don't try to begin to get her the help she needs and the minute she mess up, she's locked up. I fear for my daughter, I fear for her.",1
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,marker,00:04:41," I want to leave Detroit like on the next thing. Smoking so bad. I can put the plan together. I'm outta here because I fear for my baby. I want her to go somewhere where she's just as included as everybody else that's around her. Do I have to go to a small hick town to do that? Where do I have to go that I feel like my African American baby girl will be seen, will be heard, and will be validated for all of her accomplishments and not have to work 10 times as hard as the other counterparts to see the same accomplishments and achievements and get the same rewards?  Can she be safe? Can she call the cops just like somebody else can call the cops and get the same response? Do I have to move in a richer neighborhood for her to be able to get help? If somebody's breaking in just as quick as somebody else can get help in other neighborhoods, that's not fair. Why is that?  And why is my taxes higher? Why is my insurance for my car higher? Why is my road the worst? I go in outstate. I drive around in outstate cities and I be like, Ooh, no bumps, no speed bumps. We definitely not in Detroit. That bothers me. Why is only certain parts of Detroit being beautified and the parts they care about the most?  To my people That my baby may have to grow up in here. Not being invested into my taxes. Pay just like everybody else's. .",2
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:06:11," Domestic violence to me, like during covid 19. Everybody got to see the real people. The real monsters came out in the homes. People that was maybe able to go cheat with they girlfriends or whatever they was able to do, whatever extra release they was having was taking it all out on the people that was closest to them.  And domestic violence was on an all time high and. So many people got killed during them couple of years, and it was no outcry for that. There was no like, I feel like just like we raised the roof and kicked over things and got indignant for George Floyd's death. We should have been just outright and indignant and hitting the streets for the very first wife or domestic violence victim that got killed in they home because they was trapped in there.  Because the ' cause of Covid 19, it was like you have prosecutors , yes, domestic violence is on the rise, but yet, Nothing was being done. We were on a lockdown status. These people, the worst came out of the worst of people, and I feel there was so many lives lost that shouldn't have been lost, had society cared more, but because most of the victims.  Normally be black and brown females, they don't start caring until it's in their community. Just like even the doctor who got killed by her spouse in Oakland County, she only was spoken on for a few times, and I feel like she only got as much publicity as she did is because she was from Oakland County and she had a predominant position in the they district.  So, and that's only because had she just been another African American female, she wouldn't have got that much coverage. It would've been like a one liner, one story, and that's it.  And I feel like that's not fair because hurt people, hurt people. And sometimes when you're trapped in a situation, You need avenues to get out and we don't allow victims enough space to feel safe enough to trust us as a society to be transparent enough to say, I need help. I'm not going to look you in the face and say, I'm in a domestic violence situation and I don't trust you enough to do something other than talk about me behind my back.",3
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:08:48," I feel mental health is the solution to every problem somebody has.  If you can think it through and you got to have a clear head, and you gotta know if your thinking is thinking or if you got on the right path of thinking. And in order to do that, sometimes you need a, a. Professional to help you just be a soundboard. They don't really have to offer your opinion. 'cause most people be like, oh, I got, do people think I'm crazy if I go see a shrink or do this?  No. You crazy to keep all that crazy. Thoughts that you not even sure you understand inside of you bottled up. It's gonna blow up one way or the other and the most unexpected time whatsoever. So you might as well try to get somebody that might be able to say, I've heard of something like this. Oh, you know, it's not that uncommon then you think.  You know what I'm saying? Or somebody to be able to say, you cuckoo with cocoa puff. Yeah. You need another opinion. But I'd rather for somebody to tell me I'm crazy. Than not have the opportunity to do that. For domestic violence victims, I feel mental health would allow them to get out of that space of low self-esteem shame and all the plethora of, of negative anecdotes that comes with being in that setting.  I think it would help them build enough confidence to do the self work that they need to come up out of that. Because you can remove a victim out of a situation, but if emotionally and mentally they still there, they gonna go back. I got to mentally and then emotionally prepare myself for the, for the exile before I actually make the exile, or I'm just gonna long for home again.  Mental health should be offered to the victim as well as those who abuse people. I often feel that if my brother-in-law had got help, Real counseling that he could have seen that his way of love was not conducive to the marriage and they could have worked out him having anger issues or insecurity issues or whatever.  'cause I don't know exactly why it was he did what he did, and I'm not gonna pretend to predict it. I forgive him and I still love him and I, and it's not a day that go by that I don't wish I. That both of them was still here. And that's why I feel like mental health would have played, it would have saved my, their life.  It would've truly saved  their life. And. Even for like my family members, my loved ones, being able to seek counseling or probably save a whole lot of family. It's still a divide between the two families and it's gonna take everybody seeking.  Mental health work and working on your emotions and your mental and coming to a terms of proper grieving and it just, you, you gotta work. That's traumatic stuff you can't deal with on your own. And I think a lot of people feel like they're weak if they see their friend get killed and don't go talk to nobody.  That's not, most people don't see their friend get in front of them.",4
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:12:12," You don't want to bottle yourself inside yourself because you worried about what somebody may think of you. They definitely gonna think the worst of you if you mess around and explode. They definitely gonna think the worst of you is you in the McDonald's line and the person behind you bumped you one too many times and you turn around and just start sticking them with your EpiPen and they end up dying.  And you wonder where did all that rage come from? Because you have so much bottle inside and you haven't talked to nobody and you haven't had an opportunity to release it because most people don't even do self care. So if you not doing mental health or self-care, you are a living, breathing, nuclear bomb waiting to go off, and you are going to destroy as many people around you when you explode that that you, you may not even want to, but you will destroy everything around you and it might just be the ones you love the most.  Do you really think some of these spouses said, I'm gonna wake up today and I'm gonna kill my spouse and kill myself. Something clicked in that moment. Something clicked and they said, this is it no more. I know for a fact when my brother-in-law killed my sister, he walked out the they was at the gas station.  I seen the video. He walked back to his car and he walked back to her car and on her and shot her. Something clicked in him. If he had intend on shooting her, he would've had the gun on him. When he was in her car, when he would've had it on him, he would've never sat in her car and talked if he was intend on killing her.  So something clicked and mental health could have stopped that clicking. Mental health could have got his mental back on track where he could have seen things in a different perspective because I'm sure he must have felt like it was the end of everything. He had to feel like, I can't go past this point and I'm not.  Okay. And we gotta get people to not go get to that point where they feel like they can't go past it. Because that's what suicides come in. That's what will people go off. And I'm just gonna have a a killing spree and I'm gonna try to make the cops kill me. ' cause they too afraid to kill they self. So yes, forget a stigma.  I don't want nobody, I don't wanna be the five o'clock news, so I'd rather go to the shrink and let them shrink my little head than be the five o'clock news. 'cause I didn't embarrass my whole family.",5
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:14:43," Detroit public schools get the. Bottom of the resources. I feel like, and this have a lot to do with gerrymandering, prison gerrymandering, it's like when you lock up our residents from Detroit, when you go to any prison outta all the prisons in Michigan, the higher the largest population they're gonna have is gonna be from Wayne County.  In every prison, the largest amount of population is Wayne County. So if all of our residents is populating the, the prison system, when they do, they census, they count them in, like say for instance, Genesee County, or they count them in Ionia and that money and resources go to those schools. Mm-hmm. And it takes away from Detroit Public schools.  But however, the babies of the incarcerated individuals that's are locked up in MDOC are going to those schools. So it's like you setting them up for the prison and school pipeline. Now, because the schools are shitty, they don't get as many resources as all the other schools. You don't pay the teachers as much as they need to be paid.  And you. Cram their classrooms where they can't give our students as much of attention as they might need to excel to the best of their ability. And I feel like as suburban schools, the school ratio student to teacher ratio is not as bad. And the pay is better. And also the resources that the kids receive in those other suburban schools is much better than Detroit.  And also they grade is higher. When you get the grading system, they're higher. So what can we do to make Detroit schools just as higher? Why can't we pull all these resources to pull all Michigan schools up I don't care where I stayed in Michigan. I feel like my child should get a top A grade education no matter where I live, whether it's Flint, whether it's Jackson, whether it is Lansing or Detroit.  I want the same education level and I wanted to be the top grade.  \ I want her to have as much of a advantage as she can. Course I feel like I have a very bright young baby and I don't care. I'm now, I'm not bragging 'cause it's my baby. Mm-hmm. But I feel like she's exceptionally bright and I don't feel like she's being challenging all the ways that she can learn.  . And I feel like other school districts. Incorporate more different styles of learning and because of lack of funding, I'm dyslexic and I learn differently, and I know it takes me longer to catch up to things since other people, but I catch it, but I also, maybe somehow I have to sing it to myself or I may have to see it, you know what I'm saying?  Or somebody may have to read it, you know, or maybe hands on. It's different things that I have to learn, different techniques, so everybody is not a one way. Type learning for every subject. And I feel like because of the budget restraints, the teachers aren't allowed enough liberty to be to explore different ways of reaching their students.  And even if they did, they don't have enough capacity to do that because they're overcrowded. And that would induce extra work, especially for Detroit. So I feel, I feel like if they have more resources, they can have more teachers or they can have a bigger school or something to be able to give every student the attention that they need.  Yeah. And not say because they were a little slow, put 'em in special ed because you don't have to be in special ed just because you need to sing it to yourself to catch it.",6
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:18:33," Technology is not my best friend at all. I, it sucks. I suck. And technology, t technology sucks. Technology's supposed to make your life convenient. Well, they should tell that to people that has been in prison because I did almost 30 years and so I didn't have the advantage of growing up and like every new thing that advanced that you learned and it became like I have.  Three year olds that can do stuff better than me, and I got this wonderful job that I really enjoyed. I really love, love, love, and I'm going into that. When you tell somebody like, what's your weakness? I said, one of my biggest weaknesses was technology. Well, yet I still lost my job. Within months of being hired.  And matter of fact, weeks before Christmas I was without a job because of technology, and I had somebody actually sitting there beside me every step of the way of proving every step helping me. And it's sad because they don't think about that. It's like, It's like almost like why recidivism even exists at this point.  Because if you have somebody that's locked up for decades coming home and you don't give them no pre-training with any kind of technology, you are setting them up for failure. I'm good at what I do, but when it comes to inputting the things that I've done, I suck. It takes me longer to write a report.  For one, one-on-one that I'm having. Then it burst. I, I could have 10 one-on-ones in the time it take me to do one report for one, one-on-one, because that's how bad I suck at trying to put stuff in the computer. I'm always messing it up. After they get a new something, like I'm on my sixteenth phone since I've been home because, and it always be human error.  It never be like, maybe I've dropped a couple, two or three, but you know what I'm saying? Most of the time it was something that I did to the phone that was messed up and I had to get a replacement 'cause they couldn't fix it at the store. Like, we don't know what you did to this.",7
Kimberly Woodson, https://vimeo.com/854538208,Marker,00:20:38," But if we set up something in the Department of Corrections, it can be a dummy thing where it's only connected to like one database. Mm-hmm. Where they can like practice research and stuff. It can be like, we gonna hook this up to the legal library or something where they just practice.  Using like Google or researching stuff,  be able to have the technology at least six months in advance because you can't go over something one or two times and get it in. Like most of the applications, it's online. I had people that was like, I was ready to go, hit every spot. I had my pens ready, I was going to fill out, and they was like, go online.  Go online. And I was like, I don't even know what online is. You know, so it's like just even the terminology and the definitions will be awesome. . Something where it's a booklet or a free class that they can take upon leaving something that it can just be where we are investing in you because we know you're your future customers and we don't want you coming home not having a proper technology.",8
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:00:00," Returning citizen. I gave up 32 years of my life to the Michigan Department of Corrections. I returned home in 2017.  , some of the challenges I faced did after returning was  , getting a job, getting jobs. Because, people didn't wanna hire a felon. And then by me being gone for so long, they figured like it'd be hard for me to communicate with people learn different things, especially dealing with computers and things like that. I found a job, but. It wasn't a good paying job, but it paid up more or less.  , they didn't wanna hire you in, that's one of the things I didn't like about the job. Contractor and not an. Not an employee, but they want you to pay the taxes. So I found that bit very frustrating because you get, so far, that's the only, that's as far as you can get.  No one, you can't go no further and that's it. And by being a program, they don't offer you benefits or anything.  So I find that very frustrating.  , contract and work with the city, you in the program, you, you, they're not liable for you to be hurt on the job. You get hurt on the job. You have to have insurance, your own insurance. In order to help you sustain throughout your injury because like when I went on my I had to get knee replacement.  And so when I filed with them, they say, well, you supposed to have insurance to cover that. We don't cover that. And I didn't know that. And insurance that, that I did get from them was life insurance. Myself, I bought that myself, but it was life insurance. It wasn't accident, I guess you would say accidental or accident insurance.  . So that was, that's pretty rough on me now and recovering from surgery and it take a toll on you, and that,  and that plays into your it plays into your mental, because you already struggling out here, coming from where you came from and dealing with things you had to deal with in there. And then you come out here and you see a whole different world, 30 plus years. It's, it's a whole different world. And it, it is a struggle.  It gets frustrating at times. You wonder if you got what it takes to keep going, to make it. You see people, a lot of people, I get a, I get a lot of calls from some of the men that I knew in prison at two or three o'clock in the morning, and no calls don't be nothing. They don't be nice. And they be looking for a way to understand what they going through.  Is it any way that I can help 'em what they going through? But I'm going through it, but I'm, I'm getting help by helping them. So that's, that's, that's one part of it. And we didn't get that type of help that we needed. The mental, we didn't get to go see the psychiatrist and, and, and, and things like that when we were inside.  You only got to do that when you finna go home. When they finna release you, they run you through a little program. Boom, boom, and that's it. You don't get the real.  One-on-one or the classes that you need. And then when you get out here, they don't have that. So mental health is very important when dealing with prisoners that did an X amount of time because they be having problems. They have problems. And a lot of us, we've, before we went to prison, we had problems.  But we, we couldn't put a finger on it, but we couldn't nail it. We didn't understand it. But then when we got to prison, some of us was able to understand our plight. , some of us was able to get a hold on ourself, so to speak. But when, like I say, when you get back out here to this, to the real world, we like to say it's a struggle so I believe that a lot of us need to have something done in the mental health department, We need help dealing with this stuff because mental health is very, very important when dealing with ex prisoners because it's a lot of things that could, that could trigger.  A person and have a person go back to the same things that they was used to. And that'll hurt a lot of people. Hurt the community and hurt innocent people and even hurt they self as well. But you, you don't want that. You wanna be able to have a place they can go, someone they can talk to, someone where they can be assured.  That someone care for 'em, that they're looking out for, looking out for their best interest. So I believe that's important. .  I know a lot of returning citizens. I and I talked to a lot of 'em, and we all had the same, basically the same problems.  And if someone would just give us. Ear, maybe that'd be a difference of us making it or not making it so it's a struggle.",9
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:04:25," . My wife I, I had family support and that's what helped me. Amongst everything else, but a lot of people don't have that.  And those are the ones that you have to look out for. You have to say, it's gonna be all right. Let's look at it like this. Let's try this today. Maybe today it'll be a better day than yesterday, but remember, we are free now, so we have to free our mind. We have to free our minds. Let's work on the mind.  I had support from my wife. My wife went and testified in front of the house in the Senate and changed the bill. From, it was a successive judge, couldn't, couldn't veto you from going in front of the board. So she, they, they, they got, that law changed and I was a recipient of, of the hundreds of people that was doing life in prison.  And they changed that. And a lot of us was, was able to go in front of the board. The board saw fit that we had served enough time and we were, our record was up to par and things like that, and they, they said, okay, we're gonna give you a chance. And so in doing that, the percentage rate of recidivism has been lower.  After that 20 years, you give that person chance and if they come back, Then they never wanted that chance. And then to each his own after that. That's what a lot of people in there like to say.",10
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:05:41," Technology. It was, it was a, it was real tough because I didn't even know how to use the telephone.  you pick up the telephone and they got all these numbers on it and, and saying, text this, do that. Email this return seeing who knows all that. And if you don't go to a class or got some granddaughters or babies that know this stuff, then you're in trouble. But, so I went to a class, I was able to get in the class, but then COVID came up, shut the class down.  But the little that I learned from them at that time, it helped me. Then my granddaughters was able to assist me further because they kids are tech savvy. I was, I was blessed on that end to have that. But there's a lot of people don't have, they don't have the ability to go to a class because a class isn't offered, they should have. A class so that people can go to, not have to pay to go, you shouldn't have to pay to go. And they know that this is something that you're not able to do coming from where you came from. So they should have those classes already for you. Not like the little, like I say, they get, they did just, they crammed you in like a month before you finna go home with all this stuff ",11
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,m,00:06:52," You wanna be able to be independent. 'cause after so long being in, in that cage and, and everything is given to you all. Or, okay, let me learn something on my own and then let me go see if I'm capable of doing A, B, and C and then getting the desired result that I would like to have, 'cause then you can, you can learn how to, you can put your resume on there. you, you learn a lot of things which you can use it for, for good to assist you in elevating yourself, and that's real important.  A lot of people don't get that and a lot of, and then that just takes them back to what they know. And we know they didn't know anything before that, and then you have people who will  just go along with, just get along, but it is ripping them apart. It's ripping them apart inside and it's just, it's just a matter of time. It's just a matter of time for they turn to that ticking time bomb and they go off. You see it, you see it in the news nowadays, but it can, it, you can, you can help someone.  Some people can be saved.",12
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:07:53," Who knows about credit.  We didn't know anything. You didn't even have a job when you was out here. So when you come go to credit, they say, who are you? Where have you been? You don't even register on a scale. Who, where are you? Where are you coming from? And then you have to explain to them all that and, and then that's a big thing people need to know about how to get credit.  Not only just to get it, but to maintain it and use it properly. ' cause you'll find yourself. And a lot of debt  and those stories are being told as well.",13
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:08:21," I think that yeah, they should have a program where, like a small bank will afford you maybe say a thousand dollars and.  Teach you how to maintain and not put a big amount of interest on it and allow you to, use your credit, understand your credit, and in that way you can, you can you can build your credit up without having to take all the They come along with it if you don't understand what's going on",14
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:08:49," Returning citizens coming straight out the door. Now, if you cut out and you do like 2, 3, 4 years or something like that, then you might find some people that'll deal with you from a different perspective.  But coming straight out the gates, it's, it's tough. I know a lady that said she had to go live in an abandoned house and begin to renovate it because no one would let her. Get even an apartment because of her status. And she said once she got that house, the people finally came and said, Hey, this our house, you have to get out.  So she said she took all the stuff down. She did and went and found her another house. And finally she found the house there. The person said, you did all this? She said, yes. They say, what, you can have a house. The person actually gave her the house. Now I don't know how many times that's gonna happen in life, but when they saw what she did to that house and they hadn't did nothing with it for years, they finally, they gave it to her.  And I was like, well, we know that's not gonna happen to every, to everybody. So there it is there. We need another system for that. .",15
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:09:50," A lot of people, they, they starting to have a lot of looks at prisoners. That's who changed? you could tell, you can, you could tell when a person came in prison how they was, they was ignorant. Ignorance not a bad word. 'cause you simply don't know. There's a responsibility for you to know.  So you have to begin to know the things that you need to know in order to live a successful life. Live a crime free life. Live a life that you can be helpful to someone in some way, and then begin to uplift yourself and follow humanity. The people that need help out here.",16
Kimball Gaskins, https://vimeo.com/851156703,Marker,00:10:25," I found out that a lot of organizations in the years I've been out, they do a lot of talk. They like to be in front of the press. They like the cameras, but when it get down to the real nitty gritty to go do the work, the work isn't being done in the, in the manner in which they're speaking.  There's some, there's some groups out here that's, that's down here in the, as we say, in the dirt. That's down here in the dirt that gets the job done. But they don't have the support or the funding that some of the other groups get and some of the other groups that have the funding, they don't do no work.  It's a facade, it's just for sure they got, it's all bravado.  So we have. Find the, the groups that we have to get the groups together that's doing the work. ' cause the work only get done by those who does the work. I'm a firm believer in that.  . Because that's very important for organization. ' cause you can fund so much and you can get so many donations from Walmart or Sam's Club or whatever and do this and that, but, You need, you just need,  you need those big companies to come along and help instead of building up one area of the city, you have to build the whole city.  I listen to a lot of people and they talk a. Political stuff and I just listen to 'em. But I be, when they be talking about funding or defunding, I don't, you don't wanna defund the police department. That's not, that's not a good, I don't believe it's a good thing to do. However, if you're saying you're gonna take some money, then you should put the money in education.  And if it's in education, that means educating everybody. Return to citizens as well. . That's very important. So if they, they say, we're gonna take some of this money and do this with it, then you should send it at the returning citizens, because these are the people that has to live next door to you, that you have said is ready to return to society and be a part of society, a contributor to society, and you don't want to help them.  It doesn't make sense.",17

E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:00:00," , my name is E. B. Jordan, out of the great state of Detroit, Michigan. I am the founder and executive director of S&amp;D PJ J Housing, and I'm also the outreach director for VAC Voting Access for All. And one of the challenges I faced when I first came out was housing. I couldn't rent anywhere. To save my life.  I was part of the building trades in Huron Valley, so I figured I'd have a job with Habitat for Humanity, since they use Habitat for Humanity in prison. But when I came out, I asked, I applied for the job. They said I was a felon, so I tried to apply for the housing program, may have, and they also said I couldn't get out 'cause I was a felon.  Living on your family member's couch or your friend's couch or whoever couch after a while gets harassing and you are actually homeless. And I tried to get help through different organizations. They told me I wasn't homeless. Well, that's not my address. I'm just sleeping on the couch. So I got frustrated and I went and moved into abandoned house.  That house actually used to be a house I stayed in from zero to 18. It was my grandfather's house. But in Detroit, abandoned house come with holes in the walls and everything's stolen. So the radiator, the boiler gone, holes in the floor snatching up the radiator holes in the wall, stealing the pipes. They stole the bathroom, stole the kitchen.  It was just all closets. Taking building trades inside of Huron Valley. I put my house together. So when the sun came up, I worked the sun, went down and went to sleep. I still had my aunt that didn't stay too far from me. I went to her house if I really need to sleep and take a shower. My, my neighbors was awesome.  I went knocked on anybody door, use the bathroom, get something to eat, take a break. But I'm there now. Still working on it, but it's, it is way past. It is, it's livable. It is way livable now compared to when I first moved in. Now I just have little minor makeup things I need to do.  But then I finally went into my neighborhood, they said, what you gonna do?  You done went to prison, so what? Your house been empty for over 30 years. Nobody living in there. And so I moved in 'cause I couldn't find a place to stay.  And then I found the owner, and then they they signed the deeded over to me.  I paid for it, but they signed the deeded over to me . I actually paid attention to building trades. 'cause I came from a cooking background, so being in there and I was frustrated and I was like, you know what? I might as well get something outta this and I'm not gonna be here forever. So, and with that, I used to do odd jobs to get money to put my house together.  You know, learning how to drywall, helping people frame out stuff they need. Some carpenters, there was some paint on the wall, do some demo work. Anything that had to do with housing at that time to put my house still to get a couple of dollars. I was working under the table, but it made it happen.  .  Because getting a job, job I got, got tired of saying, you know, you, you check the box, it's a wrap. You know, my name ain't felony 'cause I got a felony, you know? I mean,  shoot.  . Besides Habitat for Humanity, I went looking. I really am not a factory person.  The factory thing was not for me. I never wanted to work with none of the big three working hard, long hours for killing your body. The two and few, the two, the, the, the two and few dollars at like McDonald's and stuff, that wasn't gonna help me. Pay for rent and eat and pay my parole officer and pay DTE.  And that was another problem. The little jobs they did have, it wasn't worth going to. 'cause it's not going either. It's gonna help me pay for my parole officer and not gave me something to eat. Or I paid for something to eat, not pay for my parole officer, but it wasn't helping me with rent if I was to actually, it wasn't livable.  And the ones that are livable you, you can't have a felony. So it was just hard.",19
E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:03:40," I actually gotta pay somebody to look at me and say, have you been in trouble? Where you staying? Did you change your address?  Are you working? I, I see you next week. , I had supervision fees. I forgot how much it was. It was a while ago. But yeah, I had supervision fees.  Get a job, because you gotta pay your supervision fees. And then I heard stories of, you know, It wasn't me, but some, you know, you violate your probation or you can't get off of parole until your supervision fees are paid off.  So I made sure my twos and fews was going there.  When you go, I was used to going in and ask for an application, but they say you had to do it online.  And so, you know, you go in and ask, can I get a application? They have your paper application. So that changed. Doing it online, no more in-person, stuff like that. Everything started phasing in to go online  go online to fill out for your Medicaid, Medicare, your, food stamps, everything went to online and talking to the computer people on the phone, and I was used to going in person and talking to people.  I, I don't like the way society has phased into dependent on technology. That's just my personal opinion.  S&amp;D PJ Housing. because I didn't want the women to go through what I went through not, So now I help women returning home from prison and hopefully in three months I have my own house.  So they will have a place to parole too. . I have different programs helping them. I do without the house. I, you can do it at my office or we meet up somewhere.  I have a CARES program right now where I meet the ladies when they get outta prison and it's a welcome home bag with soap, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, washcloth, towel mouthwash, all the basic needs.  Toiletries we need. I was embarrassed to ask somebody buy me some pads and a toothbrush and some soap and some deodorant when I first came out. 'cause I ain't have, I didn't have any money when I first came out. And so asking me, and I'm a grown woman, asking somebody to buy my toiletries was, was kind of embarrassing.",20
E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:05:38," I have another program called Free Donors Receive Education and Employment and it goes through, Writing your resume. We do mock interviews because at the interview, they're gonna look at your resume and see there's a gap in your resume and you have to explain that gap in your resume.  Like where you been, well, why, why you been gone so long. And then I have a CPA that does the financial literacy part because we need to learn how to manage our money better than. Better than we our parents did. 'cause a lot of us didn't get the financial literacy part and they don't teach it in school.  They starting to teach it now, but my age, you get a credit card, swipe it. If, if your credit bad, use your kids' social security number, get back on it. That was my era, we need to, we need to eliminate that, but, To give us more financial literacy over ourselves, period.  Because we coming out and we wanna do better than what we did when we went in. Learn about taxes. I have a lady that helps people with banking. So if you have a banking problem, you gotta go through her banking course she give you a year and then she'll straighten you out. You have a regular bank account.",21
E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:06:40," If you wanna do a business yourself and you wanna do the entrepreneurship, you know, we could get you together a small business plan. Once you finish the whole program you get a, I'll pay for your LLC and get your EIN number to start your own business. And then you walk away with a laptop and a backpack full of office supplies the simple starter stuff. So stuff like that, I feel once you establish on your feet and you're ready to build yourself a little bit more, and I also partner with an online college that does IT work so anybody's in the IT world. I got an online college. I paid for the first year scholarship, and then you can go to it school if you are interested in that because you know that's taken over and since you, you're, you are returning home.  That's something you do online as far as work. And you, you, you, you're entrepreneur, so you got a better chance of be yourself, self-employed yourself, you know, just giving you a, a, a step out there.",22
E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:07:34," And then VAC, Voting Access for All. I was not a politician. I wasn't into politics. I wasn't into none of this.  If I didn't go to prison, none of this would not have came to fruition. I would've still been in somebody's kitchen cooking something, but it took me to go in there to come back out and look at the world different eyes that I didn't pay attention to voting. I voted 'cause I was told I was supposed to vote in my household and that was it.  You go vote, go vote. But I never. Really paid attention to what I'm voting for and what, what's the use for it. And working next to Nation Outside and they pushing all these policies, they busting their butt. Now we need to go vote on them for us, for us to get our rights back. We go in different neighborhoods now they say, you know, the suburbs have this, and suburbs have that.  As I got older, the suburbs voting for all of that and we not voting. So of course they gonna close everything around us and wanna know why we don't have it. Well, we not speaking up. If you don't say anything, they gonna close it. They gonna make the decision to close it. So Voting Access for All was, was, was a great, great opportunity for me to help found.  I'm one of the founders, we need to inform people coming home. They need to learn that they had the right to vote. And then, The more we tell people they had a right to vote.  'cause I'm out in the community tabling and tabling and going to different organization, going to different type of functions to let 'em know and they like, you know, I got a felony, I can't vote. I said, I got one too, but I've been voting since I got out. Just because you got it, that don't mean you can't vote.  And they was like, well my vote don't count. And this what I stick 'em with. Let's talk about stuff that happened locally. What's happening in your neighborhood? Why don't you start there voting on that. If you had a prosecutor or if you had a judge, you know, you could vote them outta the seat 'cause they didn't put you in jail.  Whatever your reason, you can vote them out and get somebody else new in. But that person that's going in, they have all these coffees and meetups and all that type of stuff. Go figure out who running for whatever and see what they're about and then see if you wanna vote for 'em.",23
E. B. Jordan, https://vimeo.com/856513965,Marker,00:09:30," When they did the redistricting that tore us all up, they moved the lines all over the place. It's horrible. It's horrible because now a friend of mine, he was, he was he was state representative, but when they moved the lines, he lost because lines went to, into the suburbs.  He ain't know, know them people over there, they didn't know. They didn't know anything about him. Some of the suburbs coming over into the city, the line moved over into the city. We don't know that person running for that's supposed to be representing us. So that's another thing I'm kind of disappointed about moving the lines.  The fact that I am a returning citizen, I have tried my best to do everything, despite the fact I got an &quot;F&quot; behind my name.  So what I'm saying is that I am an ordained minister. I'm a nautical boat captain. So yes, I'm Captain E. B.. I can, I have my boat license, I've been to London Den Africa. Dominican Republic, Cancun, and I went to Africa because I went for a, a conference to talk about my nonprofit organization.  So over there we were in Kenya and it was 23 countries there, 97 people all saying the same thing. Return to citizens have a hard time finding housing and work. Across the country, 23 countries saying the same thing.",24

What do they like? And you set up a time for them to come pick up their Christmas gifts. So I did 50 children who parents were incarcerated. Oh wow. And that was amazing. That was, that was it. I know. And then I did Easter. I did Easter. I had Easter Bunny here passing out Easter basket for, you know, children who parents are incarcerated, low income family.  So yes, I'm a donate donating person. I get a phone call when I hear that somebody's coming home. But I just, Got in contact with Huron Valley, the parole officer in Huron Valley, and she has a list of women coming home and I can help them with the CARES Package. My programs, and like I said, right now, I personally don't have a house, but I, you know, try to point 'em in the right direction of other organizations I'm partnering with to get 'em housing.  So I help over. Couple of hundred ladies so far.",27
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,challenge_education,00:00:00," for years I worked in four different schools. My focus was English language arts, seventh and eighth grade.  Eventually education became overbearing. It's, it's changed. Teachers are required to do too much, and so I started working. I took a part-time job at Delta Airlines and I started working at Delta, and I let go of education for a while, found a new job. I was flying all over the world. I had this.  Great opportunity to experience different things. So I went away from education. Guess selfishly cuz I'm an educator at heart. But in 2018 I jumped back into education and I started educational service company that provides youth enrichment and mentoring. So my values were, you should read more, travel more, understand the habits of CEOs and develop. Tools to understand their mental health. My mother lost her mind when I was 11 years old, so I watched my mother suffer from schizophrenia from 11 till she passed when I was 27. So I kind of made myself a mental health expert watching my mother suffer. So for the years of her going back and forth to doctors getting prescribed medications, that didn't work.  And so for years I. Was right there next to her trying to figure out why my mother. And so as an adult I started to see how essential understanding of mental health was younger and younger is something that we don't talk about. As a community, when my mother was losing her mind, my mother would bust all the windows out the house, walk down the street naked.  Like I'm lucky that we didn't have a cell phone back there back then, or you would probably see my mother on some of the videos that you see on the news today. So seeing that That tragedy, that's a tragedy for a young man to see his mother in that state. You couldn't talk about it. It was nobody that I could say, Hey, I'm dealing with the worst trauma of my life over here.  So instead, I built my personality. I was able to make you laugh. I was able to talk about your truth, to hide my truth. And so ultimately what I've built now with the educational service company is an opportunity to be able to share those experiences and make sure that youth that are possibly experienced what I experienced, have out outlets and things to be able to help them to deal with the struggle of mental health in our community.  It's not just necessarily in my home, but as I've gotten older, I've. Had friends that was dealing with the exact same thing and they were like me hiding behind the mask of that trauma. So for me it is getting those resources to the youth and making sure they have access to how they can Be able to develop their toolbox and deal in these times.",28
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,challenge_child_hunger,00:02:41," youth hunger in Detroit. How can you think right when you're not eating right.  There are 300,000 school-aged children in the state of Michigan that are food insecure. Most children, they say that are food insecure, go hungry from Friday to Sunday when school is out. So most of these children rely on.  What they get from school to feed themselves so if we have students who are hungry Friday through Sunday, and then they say the last two weekends of the month, the last third and fourth week of the month when the bridge card or the food assistant card runs out, that they're most hungry.  So if we have students who are hungry on the weekend, then when they show up to school Monday, how can we expect to hold them to any standard when. Gut health and mental health inter correlated. So learning that and seeing the, the, the effects working inside of the school. I worked in Highland Park School District.  I was at Brenda Scott seven Mile in Hoover. That's considered the red zone. So I was in these places and as you look back at some of the behavior issues we faced, I'm often compelled to wonder, was it the lack of nutrition? Were we failing nutritionally? As the basis of education. So if you don't have a healthy breakfast, how could I have been grading you and holding you accountable when you didn't have the basic tools to be successful?",29
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,Marker,00:04:02," So for me, that's been another passion with mental health and food because I see it so correlated that. How can we be that beacon of education? More so not how can we feed people, but how can we teach people to fish? How can we teach people to be able to harvest their food, grow their own food?  And so ultimately that's where we're over here piloting. Now we're at a farm that has 15 acres in the middle of Detroit. And the students aren't going out and seeing, alright, I have to weed today. I have to make sure this is watered. I have to harvest the vegetables. And it's ultimately showing them where their food comes from.  The sooner you're able to understand what's in your food, how to get your food, it creates a different level of confidence. As far as hunger. If you're hungry, you liable to do anything to be able to feed yourself. But when you could be able to go in the backyard, start a small garden, start a fruit tree raise some chickens, we also have eight different animals here that students are able to work around and understand the growth and life lifecycle of those things give you the confidence to be able to.  Help build themselves. So my company is rooted in how can we expose younger youth. Right now I'm working with all students. It's probably between the age of, they're all probably 14 to 17, but ideally my thought is, We've gotta start back in kindergarten, like the things that they're over here piling is ultimately the curriculum that I wanna present to schools for the kindergarten.  Bring your kindergarten children over here and let them learn how to raise chickens and collect eggs and how to plant and harvest food because food is an issue. Those numbers, knowing that in the richest country in the world, there are 3 million children in this country that. Don't have access to healthy, nutri nutritious, nutritious food.  That's terrifying. But it's, it's more of a, I think it's more of an education issue than a financial issue because we're not taught, we're no longer taught the importance of growing and being able to control your own food.",30
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,challenge_tech_access,00:06:04," To the resources of technology, like being able to make sure youth are exposed to where technology is headed.  It's like we're being pulled through a sonic boom, how fast things are evolving and moving forward. And if you're not caught up to where it's headed, you'll be left behind. And so I think make, making sure youth have that access to. Those jobs that are going to be essential to surviving in the future.  If you don't have access to wifi, you don't have access to The future. So with those lack of resources, there's gotta be some type of programming that we create to be able to make sure that our kids aren't getting left behind.  Cause ultimately that's what it turns into is you being left behind. I think that's huge for the Detroit community.",31
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,Marker,00:06:50," Lgd educational services. Ideally, I envision my curriculum being in all schools across Detroit for youth that allow them to be able to build confidence, build understanding, and be connected to those resources. I'm all about creating possibilities for you. So the more experts that I can get these kids around, the more bosses I can connect with, the more bosses we can get to come and connect and input in the youth.  The skills that are needed, how can we cut the time that it takes for them to be successful? And then in turn, they carry and cover the nonprofit organization, urban Community Outreach, where our focus is youth hunger how can we teach the youth to understand what's in their food to better build them and be able to be.  Productive citizens in the community and in turn, impart that knowledge on those coming behind us because ultimately we're all connected, and if I'm failing, those next to me are failing. So if I'm succeeding, I should be able to connect with those next to me and help them to succeed. So, Just trying to do the work of person that I needed when I was young.  And so that's been my passion and my direction of how can I be that, that visionary and that beacon of light to help somebody behind.",32
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,Marker,00:08:06," Yeah. So, you know, now I have a therapist. Now I'm connected to a lot of the resources and counselors and people who point us in a direction. We invite them in to come talk, we invite them. We had a Narcan training here  . I could save a life. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I could save a life. Yep. So all my students, all my youth in the program were able to go through Narcan training. And so it's just things like that, just getting the experts to be able to come and say, Hey, here are these resources.  Here are the things that you didn't know we're here and this is how you can help someone else. So just finding the resources and putting them in front of these babies to be able to. Have a fighting chance.",33
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,Marker,00:08:45," As a percentage of the kids in Detroit, I probably can impact 1%, but it's, it is my ideal is. I aim to be able to pack the top impact the top 10%. If we build up and educate the top 10%, they can turn around and help lead and educate the other 90%. So my focus is how can you send me your, your leaders, send me your bosses, send me your students, your impact drivers, and then turn I'll provide them with the re resources, the experience and understanding, and then they can go back into their, They're a village and they can do the same for those that I can't reach.",34
Clarence Price,https://vimeo.com/848581988,Marker,00:09:21," So, the program we're hosting right now is partnership between L G D Educational Services, urban Community Outreach, grow, Detroit Young Talent. The Youth Connection, Pingry Farms and Milton manufacturer grow Detroit Young Grow Detroit. Young talent and the Youth Connection are both resources that are very big on helping youth get.  Access to funding and the resources that youth need. So students are paid by those organizations and they're, for six weeks, they go to different work sites to work. So Pingry Farms and Milton Manufacturing agreed to host the students here. So the students come, they have garden duties, barn duties.  We have a viticulture program that's hosted by Michigan State so students can come and learn how to grow grapes and develop grapes into jelly and things like that. We have an archery program and then it's on the campus of Milton Manufacturer. Milton Manufacturing is a government fabricator that fabric fabricates government vehicles, so ultimately student, these students can go into manufacturing plant.  You can't go to college and learn how to fabricate it. Government vehicle that's here, you literally have to go in, somebody has to take you under their wing and start showing you how it's done. So ultimately it's these students can go in and develop an engineering skill that'll pay them six figures for the rest of their life without ever going to college.  And so it's right here at seven mile and 75. Most people don't even know it exists, but to me that's the opportunity to be able to. Increase more possibility. So, Pingry Farms is a farm that's 15 acres. It's 25 acres, 15 acres of it is planet. It hosts the four H program that has eight different animals.  What makes us unique is  to join four H. To raise and show animals. Ultimately, these students have to have their own farm, or you have to go out and rent an animal. But what makes Pingry unique is that the students don't have to lease their animals. So we have eight different animals for students to learn and go to county fair and show.  Ultimately, it's just A campus of opportunity. And so the students that are over here, they're, they're making impact by improving the hoop house, improving the barn, and they're improving the gardens. So we're going to continue to collect the food, donate the food, and we got three more weeks of just them being able to do something that they normally wouldn't do.  Most of these young people would be, if I spin the phone around right now, There's eight of 'em in here. You wouldn't know it was eight of 'em in here. They all on their phone. They, none of 'em, were talking to each other. So when they come here for these five hours, when they come here for these five hours, it's five hours of me barking at 'em.  Get off your phone, come on, get out here in this garden. Come on, let's go pick this food. Come on over here and go help in the barn. And so It's exciting to see them develop and come out of their, shell start talking to each other cuz they didn't know each other when they got here. They didn't know me.  And so now through our program and through this opportunity, you can see bonds forming. You can see you've taken ownership like. Each one is taking ownership in something else they like. One of the workers enjoys working with the bunnies. So he does everything retaining the bunnies.  Another one enjoys the goats, another enjoys the garden, another enjoys the hoop piles. So it's these opportunities that I'm watching for him, and it's exciting to see young people doing things that they normally wouldn't do. It's no large farms in the city of Detroit. So where else can you get access animals and this type of garden. So it is, it is, it is definitely doing what I imagined it would do. I've been executive director at Pingry Farms for a year now. July 1st, I stepped in and my focus was to increase the education. So ideally I wanted. To be able to create a space of enrichment. I didn't expect that it would be paid, that I would have students paid to be here.  It's definitely exciting for me to see.",35
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:00:00," I grew up here in the seventies graduated from Central High School in 73.  So if you figuring out my age. Yeah, I am. , when I was coming up in high school, we did not have access to. The technology that was, that was starting to come about that was something that you really didn't see. There were no cell phones pagers. CD players, USB cords, flash drives, none of those things were available.  A lot of my technology learning was pretty much and is pretty much on hand hands-on, I should say. And just learning that. So from that, what I've experienced is that the seniors.  People, a lot of people my age, maybe even older don't really know how to operate the new thing, the new technologies that are out there, my grandkids at four years old can operate, they can tell me stuff. They can show me stuff that's happening on my phone that I don't even know, and I'm paying the bill every month.",36
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:00:57," A lot of people. A generation under me and, and beneath that had that technology given to them in school. Now what I've been put before lately we, with meeting the organization Silent Cry and dealing with people that are returning citizens and finding out that a lot of these individuals had left here, left home when they were like as young as 13 years old.  And coming home when they're like 50, 60 years old. So a lot of things that I got exposed to just from being out here in the world and having, having that opportunity to, to witness the new technologies and, and experience a lot of it myself. These individuals didn't from 13 to 40, 50, 60 years old.  They come home and they're expected to, to get just engulfed in, in what's happening in the world right now. And they don't have any, any information on, on what, what a lot of this is. Even with cars, the cars that we have now, I have a car that. You don't even put a key into it. You just push a button in.  It starts up and you don't even have a gear shift. You push a button and it shifts gears for you. Those technologies weren't around when these individuals left and left home, and now they're back and they're expected to know how to do this. Even with television.  We, a lot of 'em, we didn't have cable at one time. If we didn't have cable and internet, So we just had an antenna and, and maybe a remote control. VCRs were out with, , the tapes that you put in, we had those were available, so now we don't even use those anymore. So your television is a smart tv.  So you have to learn how to operate all these new things.",37
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:02:49," They don't have the money. To be able to call them and put money on their, on their cell phones so they could make phone calls. And I remember early on when he was in, you would have to put money onto onto his books so that you can make a phone call and it would, if you put $20 on onto the book for him to make a call, the, the service would take, I think, up to about $5.  Just a call. And then each call costs so much money per minute. So you're only making, if you're lucky, maybe you'll get two calls out of that $20. And a lot of these families, $20 is a lot of money. They don't have it to, to issue out like that. So, The contact with their families is, is very minimal. And then you have some of them.  I know there's one young man that was working with Silent Cry agency. He went in when he was 13. He come out, he's 50 something years old, and all of his family have passed away. So he comes home and there's no family available to him. So it's, it was hard. Hard for him to adjust and it's still hard for him to adjust to living out here in the world.  Very talented young man. Very, very gifted. He learned how to how to write papers for inmates and that kind of helped keep money coming in for him 'cause he would write letters and, and different, things that he would write for them to, to submit to courts.  And so he, he learned how to do all, all of those things. And and that's what he said, it, it kept him able to have funds to buy food and deodorant, toothpaste and stuff that a lot of us just take for granted. Here on outside and not having family available to help him out. He just found a way to survive in inside.  So now he's out and he's doing the same thing, surviving ' cause there's no skills affordable to him. And then coming out with a felony, where do you work and where do you get loans and where do you find housing and. No family. So what do you do? And what I saw with a lot of, especially the men, is they get attached to a woman that they meet that correspondence or they come up and visit and they get paroled to that female, that woman.  And while they're on probation for the few years, because they come out, even though they got out, they're still put on probation for a couple years. And if they mess up, On that probation, they go back.",38
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:05:13," It's a different scenario, unfortunately, like with my nephew he got life.  So but everyone that, that was locked up with him or out except for him, 'cause he wouldn't snitch. He wouldn't tell. So he's still locked up. But there was some flaws in his case that the family has an attorney that's been looking at it, but even with, with our family is everybody, , trying to chip in.  It's expensive. It's still expensive. When you're talking about several thousand dollars at a time, that's gotta go for filing paperwork or for the attorney to look at the paperwork. And those are hours of of time. So it's been a few years that we did find an attorney that was willing to look at his case.  'cause he also happened to be an ex-offender who got out on a, on a technicality that happened in his case that he found. So he's using those skills. To help others that are, are locked up un unjustly or unfairly. So, but for, for families and for these young men and young women, there's a lot of women, a lot of women that have been locked up as teenagers and a lot of them, , for the crimes that they committed was, a lot of it was for self defense.  'cause of women, women get raped, they get beat, they get. Really put in bad situations to make them do things that they really don't wanna do, but it becomes a, a thing of survival for a lot of them. Or like one young, one young woman that she served 30 years in, she killed someone that was trying to rape her little sister, and I think she was, this, this lady was about 16.  So her little sister was much younger, but she got out because she was a juvenile lifer.  So it is, it's a, it's a real sad state of affairs in America.  , but a lot of these young people were released ' cause a lot of their cases were, were tried unfairly and unjustly for.  Well the young man that I was talking about, he killed his mother's boyfriend because his, he was abusive and he was only 13, but a child tried as an adult, and I think that's what the, the problem was, is that these people were were tried as, as adults and they were children. And not good representation.  You, you grow up fast, you learn how to survive. Whereas here, when you were out, you had your, your parents or your other family members that will help you maneuver through going into adulthood, , but they don't, they didn't get that.  And, and the the staff inside doesn't become their parents at all.",39
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:07:44," I'm really a big supporter with Silent Cry. And I, I try to get the, get the message out that these things are happening and have happened and that where awareness, awareness has to happen, that these things are going on and still going on, and especially with our children.  It, it hasn't, it hasn't changed. Even though they did pass that law. Let all these people out, they're still, they're still incarcerating young people. , and people of color and people with less economic standards. They're, they're treated less than everybody else. So they get, they get used and, and, and put into situations that if you had the money or if you look different than me, you would probably get away or get out or get more help.  And even once you, if you do and you come out and you look different than me, you probably would get more access to resources that will help you along the way. , it's still lopsided. It's still, it's still still got one leg, ? And then, and our system is still limping and it's still blind.  The only thing we can do is that everybody, that I think, that everyone that, that has a, has a soul and, and want to see something happen, you don't really have to have a lot of money to, to try to make a difference. You just gotta have a, a ear and a heart to see a change. , sometimes all it takes is one person willing to just listen.  Sometimes all it is is, is just a touch., a consoling touch that, that you're listening and you have compassion. You don't have to be what they call a sucker for stuff, but you just have true compassion and understanding as to what's happening with these people.",40
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:09:22," It's just that people, people just need support and compassion.",41
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:09:26," the whole world knows that America locks up more than 50% of their African American population. . And they know that America is built on the idea of slavery, free labor when they're in prison, free labor. What they make? Some people, some of them, I think they increase the money now, I think they get like maybe $2 a day or something like that.  And if you got a lot of the parents that are in there and their children are in the foster care system or on the welfare system, that money has to be paid back. They're gonna pay back that money on $2.  It doesn't work. It doesn't work. So when they come out, if they come out, you got child support, you owe, you got restitution, you owe, you need to get a place, you need to get a car. How do you survive?  And you're not supposed to go back into your old neighborhood. . So where do you go? Where do you go? Who's gonna take you to find out that, you're returning citizen? . Who's gonna do that? , so there, there's a lot of education that needs to happen to the general public.",42
Wendy Dorsey, https://vimeo.com/856543515,Marker,00:10:29," no education. The, the schools, the schools in, in the poor neighborhoods, there are hardly any, , in the city of Detroit there's over 200 closed schools, 200.  Where are these kids going to school? They gotta get up in the morning at five o'clock and get on the bus at 6 30, 7 o'clock to get bused. 10, 10, 20 miles away. And then you don't, they don't get back home until four or five o'clock in the evening.  Who, who? What? And their parents probably aren't there 'cause they gotta work somewhere. They gotta work one, two jobs. So the kids are home by themselves. And then of course they're gonna get into stuff. Their friends are doing things, they're gonna do stuff, there's no supervision. And then they're going to a school in a community that don't want 'em in there.  The schools, the school system, the public school systems aren't, aren't up to par like they should be. Then the kids are tired. They gotta get up if they get up and go, because after COVID, a lot of kids don't go anywhere. They, they still at home and they're behind. So what do you do? You do other things.  'cause you gotta eat, you gotta live somewhere. , mom don't have a lot of money. Grandma don't have a lot of money. Grandma don't, , she barely making it on, on $800. Social security check. If it's that much. She gotta feed these kids 'cause Mom is not around anymore. And after Covid, we lost a lot of people just from Covid.  So what do you do?  Like, what do you do? So the, the general public, the public at large needs to be more informed. They need to be willing to listen to what is really going on in their neighborhoods and in their communities. They need to really, really get more involved in, in speak out at city council meetings community, community meetings.  They should have a school in their district. They should have. Grocery stores and things affordable to 'em that they can walk to. They should have busing a, a, a bus system. We don't have, a lot of 'em don't have that anymore. They just don't have it. When I was going to school, we just walked up the block.  There was a school. It's not, and a lot of schools aren't there anymore, so the kids are so who's paying for that?  There, there's a problem. So, and I, I think a lot of it lies at home. A lot of us at home, in our own communities, with our own families, with the neighbors, we need to, we need to be more in tuned and more involved. We need to. We really do need to take the blinders off and go do something. , when you sit back at home and you just peek out the window, 'cause you don't want to be involved and you don't wanna be a part of it, it doesn't solve anything.  It's not gonna help you and it's not gonna help your your, your community.  And you do need to learn how to vote. It does work. It does work. Get involved. We have voices for a reason.",43
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:00:00," . So what I'm seeing as far as returning citizens when they're coming out any barriers or concerns? One thing that I'm seeing, and maybe they don't know how to communicate it is that when they, when they come back trying to merge with a family after they've been removed for so long, and especially the men, the men are coming back, the men are supposed to be the head of the household, right?  And so coming back to a household where now you're an alpha. With, you know, maybe it's another alpha there. Maybe the child has now become that person that has been helping mom try to hold the family together. So there's a struggle. Right? And it's a struggle. And I don't think that they understand why the struggle exists.  The pa the passing down of the torch or how we were brought up that the men is supposed to be the head of the household and we know at a lot of the households it's the women.",44
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:00:53," And then on the other side, the women who have been removed from their children's lives and now they wanna come back and connect with their children's, where they could only see them during a certain time when they were told they couldn't touch 'em, they couldn't do anything.  And someone else in the family is raising the child. The grandparents are raising a child. And of course, you know, we've all had that where our parents, no matter how old we are, they still think they know better than us. Well, these are my children, right? These are my children, and I understand that you've been taking care of them and you did a great job, but now you need to relinquish that.  I think there needs to be more services , to help the family with those, those challenges. Because what happens is it's so toxic. It's so toxic that the kids are taking away the, the argument, the the feeling of inadequacy the, the self-doubt. You thought you were ready when you got out, but you weren't equipped with everything.  You've been away for a long time. Things look different. You know, there, there is time that's needed for you to get acclimated. So that you can be that sole provider.",45
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,m,00:01:53," , it's the, the network of folks, the having the awareness and creating this support system before they get out. Recognizing who the support system is and getting it validated before they come out.  Don't tell 'em once they get out, have it already in place. Right. Already had them introduced to it like we're talking now. Virtually they can do that. They right. The, the judges talk to them virtually sometimes, right? So there, the tools are there, we just need to use them and we need, we, society needs to create this for them.  They don't know what they need. And so I like the fact that you're interviewing and asking people, I've not been incarcerated. I have I was almost, so, I think I'm scared straight, so I didn't get a chance to go. But I'm among people who are returning citizens all the time, and I'm wowed by them. I just had a class on Saturday Michigan Liberation in Detroit, and there were three facilitators, three young black facilitators, and two of them were returning citizens powerful.  They had to be in their twenties, early thirties. I'm 51 years old. Powerful. I don't even know if I was speaking like that at that age. So somewhere in that time, either they had it before they went in or they developed it, or somebody poured into them while they were locked up. I know for sure when they got out, they found a support system, something they believed in, and they poured all their time and energy into that.  A good organization or a good group to look at when people come out and they feel like they don't have a skillset is some grassroots organ organizing because there's always so much work to do, even when you find self-interest, when you find that you're interested in this or you have these problems.  So I wanna work on this for somebody else that's grassroots organizing. So I think for those people who already don't have stuff, stuff set up where they have self-doubt, We can use this time to train them. All of that money is being pumped in. That training is free, and they're among other people who believe in them.  And if we don't have them around, people who believe in them, they're gonna go back into the system. So that's what I see.",46
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:03:59," A lot of people just never got a driver's license, right? So now they've been tucked away for a while and they come back and a lot of people.  Don't have a high school education. So can they even pass the test? Is there somebody that interprets and read for them? Like, my children are on individualized education plans, the IEP, right? So when they take their test there, there's somebody, a aide that reads to them and they verbalize that who is standing in the place of those people who don't understand the words that's on that driver's license test.  It doesn't mean it can't drive, it just means that they couldn't comprehend or read.",47
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:04:30," So I have two, so I have a 31 year old. A 28 year old and a 13 year old, and my 28 year old and my 13 year old both have individualized education plans.  Although I think my 13 year old is this just the brainiest of the three? I think he just doesn't apply himself. I think he, he has fallen victim to what this lead crisis may have been in Flint. So I think that's where some of his disconnect is because he was a kid that was walking at seven months and never crawled.  Like he had a first everything and then all of a sudden it was a big switch and there's a problem. So with him, I put him in a different category because it could have been the lead poisoning. We don't know. We won't know for years to come. But my 28 year old, he the reports I used to get on him really saved him because I came from, I came from a family where they believed in whoopings.  You know, if you didn't do something right or whatever, this is the way you were taught. I hate to say it now, but when I look back at it, it was conditioned from slavery, right? I beat on you and you don't do whatever, right? So we know that's wrong. So my son would get D's and E's, but I would tell you this, before his teachers would show me his report card, they would tell me how thoughtful, respectful.  How delightful he was to have in their class, how they would work with 20 of him every day. They would, no matter what teacher, they would big him up. And then they would show me his report card and say, well, mom, I want you to know he came in and got extra help in the morning. He, he stayed after school.  He got help. He, he ditched lunch, he got help. And so all those things helped me because I knew he gave his all, he gave his best. And another thing that came out was they said generally kids who got grades like him had behavioral problems and he didn't have any behavioral problems. Right? He was the clean cut kid.  He was a respected kid because that's how he was rear. And I worked with him just to get the D's and the E's. I knew it was a challenge 'cause I was up in the middle of the night doing those type of things. So I think too, Your background. You don't have to be a product of your environment, but those people who have already gone, gone into the jails and they weren't all bad.  Some of 'em came from affluent, , homes and, they had education, but they chose to, they chose to go down this path or they got caught, right? But, Coming back, their challenges may be something different or coming back. They might already have a job set up for them. You, we see all the time on tv it, it's on, it's on tv.  You can come from a good family and commit a crime. That family's gonna take care of you. You always have a job. It's people under you and you still doing that. Now you doing white collar crime instead of the blue collar crime and, and you know, you got an another layer there. I just think there's a lot of things that go into.  Why people are returning and the services and programs that need to happen for them. I don't know everything. You don't know everything, but they have to communicate more what their barriers are. The problem is a lot of the ones that are in there haven't used their voice. That's why they've been doing the wrong things.  They don't know how to use their voice. Is there somebody really there listening to them? Are we just trying to get 'em out, crank 'em out? Oh, they out, we know they gonna come back. It's a big business. I think that they're withholding some of the programming that they know they should have been giving these people so they could come back.  That's what I think though. That may not necessarily be true.",48
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:07:54," I'm a community champion. They call me Community Holly. A lot of people are like, oh, that's Holly, you know, community Holly. They don't know what hap that I'm speaking from.  Because I wear so many. But my current job I work for Michigan United. It's a grassroots organization and I'm in the movement politics department and my region is Detroit, Genessee County and Saginaw, and pretty much. What we do well, I'm in movement politics, but as an organizer slash outreach manager.  Pretty much what we do is identify injustices and we build campaigns around those injustices. So I may go to, the local grocery store or some other businesses, and I build a relationship so that they understand who we are, what we're doing in the community, because a lot of people come through their doors and they have with whatever problems they have, right? They hear a lot of things. They're, they're like the social worker, right? And they don't even know it. They're a grocery store, but they see the same people. The people that live in the neighborhood, they are yet another source of support, right?  But if they don't know how to connect the information they receive from those people with another group who's doing it. Then we, we leaving a lot of power on the table. I'm just one vessel to connect that. And grassroots. I also belong to a couple of faith-based organizations where we have an obligation to the community.  So I'm a a Eastern star, which is auxiliary to the Masons, right. And then I'm a daughter, which is the auxiliary to the Shriners, all has a Masonic foundation.  I know I meet people where they are and I think that I have an engineering background. I worked for General Motors for five, six years as an engineer, and I think those, those critical skills that I learned in college and then on the job are things that help me look at things a little different here.  In the community. Because you know that critical thinking, I always try to figure out why is that happening? I may not know why, but I see about five things that I can flag. Is there something I can do to eliminate one of those things or help to make it better? Or immerse that those five things now into three instead of the five.  I try to eliminate silos when I see people working in silos and they're overworking themselves like myself burnout, right?  And then a lot of people don't wanna use their voice 'cause it's like nobody caress, it's just me. Or you have people who are waiting for others to come save them. It's time out here in Genesee County. We can't wait for nobody to come save us. The, the factories are not coming back. We'll be waiting. If we keep waiting, we won't even have a house.  We got a lot of houses with tarps on them. So you've got people who've been incarcerated who come back to Genessee County or come back to Flint on the North end or anywhere in Flint. And the house they used to live in and grew up in, they got a tree growing up the middle of it. But they stand there, they living in the house, the lights is on, but the water is off.  This is real stuff. You just think about it. We live in Flint and I don't know where you live, but I live in Flint. We still can't use our water. So a lot of this weighs on your mental health. Right. It weighs on your mental health. I have to drive past abandoned schools and houses with tarps on them. We have food desert, and by the time I get to where I'm going I'm mentally exhausted and drained.  I'm, I'm depressed, right? So if I'm not incarcerated and I feel like that, I can only imagine how they feel when they're feel inadequate, when they come out and they don't have the support system. So I feel like when they don't have stuff set up for them and they're looking for jobs and they might be, you know, $5 away from committing a crime right to eat or whatever it is that they want, connect them to a grassroots organization.  I think they can get all of that and people will build, you know they will want to pour into their development and they can build in on their skills and we can work at something together is what I think.",49

So when General Motors pulled out, I mean, we have a few factories, but this whole time was General Motors, right. So they moved out for a lot of different reasons. One of the reasons if you look at the research was because the water was rusting their brand new cars before they could sell 'em. So if the water was rusting their cars, why would you give it to the people to drink?  So that was one of the reasons. Look it up,",51

It took their family.  They want a better quality of life. So when those people picked up and left, and then you know, like every 10 years we get the census. When you only have so many people here, the resources to keep those institutions open, you don't get that amount of money. That's why they always do that count. You know? I don't know if you have kids that are in school, that's why don't count day.  They want everybody there. Well, it's the same thing with the census. They only do that every 10 years. So if your population is this for 10 years, you gotta deal with that amount of money. Now we could get a surge and get a lot of people come in right now, but we still gonna have that same small amount of money that was allocated from 2020.  We're not gonna do it again until 2030.

Let me tell you, I live in a neighborhood called Civic Park, and Civic Park was the first neighborhood that General Motors built for its employees. I just described what my neighborhood looked like.  There's no way you should be going to any other neighborhood, but the first neighborhood that you set up for your people. And you help contaminate the water before there was any regulations you was dumping in the water. I know you was. Everybody were, there was no regulations. Nothing was given you, so you contributed to that.  Did they come back and clean up? No, they did not. Did anybody make them? No. You know what they did? They got their fancy lawyers and they let somebody else go in and buy whatever under whatever name and buy. So now it's not their responsibility to come back and clean up. They were moral responsibility to come back and clean up this water because it's their mess.  And then you leave the neighborhood and you don't fix the neighborhood. The neighborhood that you said you built for your people,  Feel like that and I'm not incarcerated, what about the people that went in when their grandparents and their parents worked for general?  There was never a poor person when General Motor was here. There was not poverty. Everybody worked. Think about that. We're a very small town. I can't tell you what the numbers is, but everybody worked for General Motors. There was no poverty, there was no ghetto, there was none of that. That did not happen until General Motors left.",53

So now, like I just finished lobbying in March, $20 million for them to put in the spending budget for. Violence interrupters for urban communities. Why do we need that? Because these urban communities don't have enough resources to pay for the police. Well, even if we have the police, the, the community doesn't want the police because the police are doing stuff like choking us out and killing us, right?  So we're like, you know what? We know we really can't police ourselves, but we need to figure out what things we can do before we call the police. So there needs to be training. There needs to be, who do I go to? I don't wanna call the police because, Even my, my, my youngest child and my grandchildren traumatized.  They would see the police when I was young. We saw the police, we wave at the police. I don't know about you. We waved at the police and the firemen and stuff like that, right? These kids run from the police and no reason to run from the police. They run from the police. You know why? Because police are bad.  Because when they see the police, police are coming into their homes or. Dragging their loved one out, their father, their brother, their whoever, or they're riding past and they see people on the side of the, the road with their hands clapped behind their back and they're like, oh my God, the police, the police are some, they're bad people.  They're gonna destroy my family. I. Me and my sister are hungry. My parents are on drugs, but we do have a house, right? But we're out here. We're out here after hours because we're walking five blocks over. 'cause I know a teacher that's gonna feed me, but now I'll try to get home and the police are all, let's take off running.  And then the police chase us because they think we've done something, because we're running. And then either we get killed or we get accused of something that we didn't do. I'm just saying that's real.",54

If you look up Hamilton Health Network, GoFundMe and put Holly Wilson, you'll see my story there. But We, the residents, said there was something wrong with the water. It smelled funny in some areas.  It tasted funny for me. It tasted funny 'cause I, I was anemic. I ate ice and it was funny and I thought maybe it was some old ice, because at the pot I spent 12, 16 hours working at the fire department. And so I would go get the ice from upstairs that they had in like the big fire chest that they would use.  . And so I was like, well maybe I'm getting the bottom of the barrel or something. Right. And so I'm studying, eating this ice. We're still bathing them with it. You know, all of these things. So just think about it, in the schools, the kids were drinking from the fountains. Yeah. And the jails, they were drinking the water in the jails.  So I know that the concern is the kids, and it should be there are today or tomorrow. There are yesterday, but they're not putting emphasis on the elderly or the adults. Well, these people were also poisoned, these adults who were in the jail. So when you talk about returning, maybe they weren't well on the way to rehabilitation and maybe the lead in the water that they were exposed to in the jail caused them to have this disconnect in chemical imbalance.  And now they're in there.",55
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:16:57," , I worked at 9 1 1. There was so many times where people called, they sound sane. You know? It's a very thin line, right? A very thin line.  So somebody can talk to you, you not even know that. They're in another reality, you not know because it's making sense what they're saying until it doesn't make sense. And people with mental issues will call some of them returning citizens or should be in there because of some of the things that they were doing.  But they would call 9 1 1 for whatever reason. It's some people that broke into my house. I remember doing putting in a home invasion call. They were like, it's three people. Three people sitting on my couch and I'm asked them to leave. So I look, I see what neighborhood they calling me from. So I'm thinking, I'm thinking as they're saying this, I'm thinking, well, maybe there's some drug dealers that came in and you know, took over.  'cause this person is like, I'm like, do they know you're on the phone? They're like, yeah, they're sending. And I said, well, tell 'em to leave now while I'm on the phone. I'm dispatching somebody. There's a home invasion. And they're like, leave. And I said, what are they saying? They're not saying anything.  Like, what are they doing? They're watching tv.  And I'm like, okay. Anybody else there? Yeah, some other kids in the house. So I'm, I'm sending messages for the police to hurry up and get there. I'm calling resources from everybody to come. Right. Well, when the police get there, the person has a I don't wanna say the term on here, but they're in a system.  As mental incapacitated . But then here's the deal, it's kids in the house. How can we allow kids to stay in the house with someone who has checks out a reality? The same thing. If you think that it's okay for the kids to be in the house with somebody who checks out a reality, don't you know that the kid is learning this behavior and they think it's normal because that's the only behavior they see?  Mm-hmm They think it's normal. So what happens is when they get older or not older, when they're out here exhibiting what they've been taught, where do they end up in jail?  You are not even thinking about that stuff. All of these, all of these things is like a domino effect.",56
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:18:47," First of all, a person needs to know, they should have somewhere to lay their head when they get out where they're gonna go. You have to make sure that they're equipped somewhere to lay their head, not for a day or a week or just for a month. You have to know there should be some type of agreement entered into before they come out.  And I believe that the system should get involved with making sure that happens because they don't have a word to lay their head. They don't need to get out. What's gonna happen? . An infraction right there. You can't be vagrant. You what? At some point you wanna go, go inside.  It snows here. So they're gonna break into a structure. It might be a lived in structure, it could be an abandoned structure. All of those are infractions. So first of all, when they get out, where they going? You need to make sure they have a place. You need to make sure there's some type of agreement. And in that time, you need to make sure somebody's helping them get a job.  They said, oh, we, we do that. We, we make sure they do that. Okay, well then you need to start with a state ID or a driver's license. They can't get a job without that and then they can't get a state ID or driver's license without a social security card. These people have been locked up for a long time.  Can't get a social security card out, birth certificate. So where they gonna get that from? I wait. So you're setting them up for failure?  . And then you tell the people, you're not doing your outta compliance.  You're not doing what, what we asked you to do. Yeah. You might be able to get some emergency food stamps if your state allows for that. All states are different. Yeah. Yeah.

Right. So think about those people who are shouting from their lungs or using signs or those people who are picketing or write signs or write a letter to policy makers. Can't you see employing these people who are having a hard time getting a job? Can't you see taking all of that, that that energy, that that frustration, that really what it is, is power that's built up that they aren't.  , it's mismanaged and it's used in a way that gets them put back in the system.",58
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:20:49," Here they have a program called Work First, and it's not about the incarcerated people, although they do help them. They say those people who are at risk and low income, everybody in Flint is at risk. And the poverty level here is, it's low, it's not many people Listen, people who are retired make more money than I do.  Because they retired from General Motors when money was good and they worked 40. My dad worked 42 years. What he make in retirement is more than I make now. And I put in hard work. Not to say he didn't put in hard work, but you know, money, it was, it was a better time. Every house was lived in, every line was mowed.  All this dilapidation and stuff did not occur. It just didn't, they were still trying to build schools, like people were having kids. It was just a happy time. These people here, they're just trying to survive any way they can. And the problem, the problem with is happening with this. If the answer is not to institutionalize them, the problem is to catch them before they go in and provide them the services.  Here's the deal. When I went to it was a Spring Lobby conference in DC it was put on by the Quakers, I think it's for its Friends Committee on National L egislation and we were talking about violence interrupters. And so I, at, at the time, I got up and I was able to speak, there were some people there who were from rural areas.  Who didn't experience rapid gunfire daily, like we hear gunfire daily, we still watch tv. We don't, we can hear the gunshot and know just how far it is before we determine if we gonna take a dive. We are like, oh yeah, that's down the street, that's around the corner. We don't even look outside anymore. But you in those other areas, if you're here, here, Cars screeching, somebody yelling.  You got everybody and their mama coming out trying to see that's how it was back in the day. They don't do it now. Everybody's like, I don't wanna be involved. . You gotta change the mindset.",59
Holly Wilson, https://vimeo.com/852556837,Marker,00:22:42," So if we, so I just talked about those people who could leave Flint for a better life. You know, people who rent. Perfect example. People who were renting during the water crisis when they said, yep, it's bad water. People who were renting. Picked up and left and went to another city. So the water crisis contributed to the dilapidation too. So, because I'm renting, it's not mine, I'm not vested. Well see. I own my house. So I own my house and a couple other properties that, you know, make up my big lot. And so I, I'm just not gonna throw that away to leave. But other people who didn't have an was invested.  They left. But guess what? They were the same people who were raising their kids, who had the same issues, who believed there was nothing different than what they were seeing every day. Walking past these homes, these burned down schools, these houses with trees in the middle and a food desert. So they took that same, the same anger they had in them when they lived in Flint.  They took it to this rural area. And what do you think those people saw when they got there? They saw these angry people, these people who are criminals. Oh my God, we're afraid of them. They're the same people who were in the other city. So by not giving them the resources and trying to, before they go in jail, not trying to do that, what you did was create epidemic in a rural area that wasn't used to seeing that they lived off the land.  These people came from an urban area. They finna take that. All of that stuff you don't like they did in their community, they bringing it to your community. It don't stop because they changed the face of the community. It's still ingrained now. So you have to change the mindset of the people, provide them with the resources that they need.",60
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:00:00," , I was just telling a friend yesterday. A really close friend about my disappointment and it relates to, to incarceration, But also just my expectancy of what the future would hold. And I was explaining to them how like, I'm really disappointed that in a lot of dystopian films or books that I read, those who are the underserved, I.  There was always those who, who seemed to have some connection to technology, They still were able to get access to enough of the parts or information or knowledge to assemble something on their own in their hobble they, they didn't have running or clean water, but they could utilize this information in some pieces and parts and create something wonderful,  and that's not what I see. In today's present, which is supposed to be a future I was supposed to look forward to, I don't see any folks who I know who are in any of these neighborhoods that I go into who are speaking in code, who are telling me about this and that. and when you do find it, it's an anomaly.  It's something you like. Oh, oh, wow. Because you recognize just like it's a food desert, it's a technology desert. Right. And not just technology, but information about technology, the understanding of it,  There's so much technology that they have and that we should have, but just not everyone has access to, This is the future we were promised in the eighties and the nineties anyway,",61
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:01:07," my story starts in Detroit. It takes a progressive step towards the Detroit suburb of Southfield.  Like we were three houses across the, the, the divider line we had made it. And then it transitions to prison term at 17 years old, which saw me spending 20 years incarcerated. And then there's the return for the last five years. So, I'll, I'll kind of go backwards in a way, because the return is kind of the most immediate and the things I overcame and the difficulties I face can all be traced pathologically back to the beginning,  So I'm one of those folks that was like really fortunate in that I understood technology in the ways that a lot of my, like contemporaries didn't a lot of folk when I was inside. When I was younger, I, I just always had a I don't wanna say a knack for it, but an interest. And I was fortunate enough that, when I, when I was coming up, my parents cared enough about me and my interest that they had got me like this encyclopedia set,  And so, and that would like, so now I'm getting to learn about everything and, and so when I get a, a video game system is something different to me. But I never got to, like, I, I was never like the idea of like opening stuff up and tinkering with like that was never something I had to, I. Idea. I had the idea for it, but never the ability to, because I mean, let's be honest, you gotta have resources for that.  Like if your parents went and broke they back and sweat to get you this video game system, you bet not break that thing apart. I don't care how much you think you might find out or, or where you think you might be in the future because you learned about circuitry, so, so it was one of those things where it's like, even when you have the idea, you don't necessarily have the ability to even, tinker with stuff yourself because of socioeconomic issues.  But I always had an interest. Science was always my thing. And so when I was incarcerated, I was a person that science digests and sci-fi news that was the stuff like I, that would, would be some things I would do for my own personal interest to kind of feed my own soul. And also it kept me. Abreast of what was going on.",62
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:03:00," While I'm incarcerated, I end up signing up for what's called the Legal Writer Program.  So I'm really, I'm like pretty good at the law because, I was trying to appeal my own case. And so just, by circumstance I became educated and the idea of helping other folks was like, yeah, you don't wanna have your knowledge and go to waste, and they were gonna pay me for it.  So it was like, win-win. And ironically enough, they were gonna pay me, which is the highest rate anyone in the MDOC can get, Like it was, it was, it was the baller status of $3 34 cents a day. When most people were getting 17 and a half cents an hour or something like that.  I was getting $3 34 in a day now. But the real boon of that was I then had access to a laptop. I had to go through a training. I had to, 'cause I had to prepare folks legal brief. I had to communicate with the law firm I  so I would prepare legal brief through the research, et cetera, et cetera, or any post-conviction remedy. And I would submit it to them for approval. They would go over it for something to be fixed. They would fix it, some new case law, whatever it may be. Because, we also did research and we got up to date case law, and then I would send it, I would give it, prepare for the person and help them mail it out, et cetera.  So that meant that every day. I was at a laptop, at a desktop, and at one point even I had a little notebook. They had something happened wrong with the desktop and they gave us these little notebooks, So I was having this daily connection and understanding with how to navigate windows and sub folders,  Graphic user interfaces, all of that. So my experience knowledge is so different right now. I didn't realize that completely until I come home. And for me it's like, I can't wait. When I first got my, when I got my first phone, maybe the first couple weeks I was home, I used to have nightmares about breaking it.  I would have literal nightmares where I would wake up thinking I had broken my phone or dropped it. Right. It was so important. It was so much the key to what was gonna make me a real human being out here. Right. I, I'm gonna be a real boy. And so it was, I was fra but I found that I had an aptitude for, or familiarity with it.",63
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:04:50," A lot of folks who I was coming home with didn't, and especially I and I, that I think I expected, what I didn't expect was to come home after 20 years of incarceration. The only technology I had access to was, again, a desktop. I'm, and like, I'm not even using Google Sheets or anything. I'm using Open Office,  like, we're not even using, like, so I, it's not like I'm in here doing, doing some weird stuff. And then we ended up getting some digital MP3 or MP4 players. So music listening. And they will also allow you to craft little letters through the JPay system. And you can also download photographs that your friends and family sent you.  That's the technology everyone in MDOC had access to. . And it's very much just like you would imagine on a, a player on your phone, it's, it's a few menus. . What I wasn't prepared for was that so many of folks who are already home, my friends and family and loved ones, would be so behind.  I didn't expect to come home and I become the tech guy, not even six months from being home. Yeah, yeah. Seriously. I'm the one going through the phone, connecting this, showing 'em how to do that, finding why this is doing that, recognizing that you got some malware, like, I. But that I would have to do that with people who were already out here the past two decades.  That's what really blew my mind. So when now I get a job at a place, so I ended up getting this offer to become an executive director to nonprofit called A Brighter Way. And the nonprofits focus on helping folks who are returning from home especially longer returning citizens, but anyone returning from home in Washtenaw County to to have a mentor to assist system with their transition and also to providing what's called, like we call wraparound services, That goes from anything from housing assistance to covid assistance, to job assistance, to interview assistance, to resumes, whatever. Because you can't assume that someone's coming home from incarceration and only needs a thing or two, you have to look at that whole person and their whole needs. So while doing this is when I came into real direct contact with just how far behind we are when coming home from incarceration and not just because this is the important because.  Time away from society further stagnated us. But because before we went, even went in, we were already behind. We never, we, we weren't going in with any, any, any route to latch onto. No familiarity to begin with. So now you take someone outta society who, before they left only knew of email from a television show.  It wasn't prior daily interactions or needs, and 20, 25, 30 years later, you bring them home and let them know, like, Hey, you gotta know how to do this. Not only do you have to know how to do it, you have to understand what it is, why it is, and how it works. Like you would have, had you grown through it, had you grown up with it, And the major things like the, the thing I think that troubled me the most was that it's no easy fix. we, we we're, we're forgetting that. Those of us who are familiar with this, we became so over time by ourselves, over someone guiding us over catching some piece of information on television that made sense to us because we knew, right, that commercial maybe that said something about, oh, GUI, you knew that because you knew what G U I was.  So it made something happen for your brain that it didn't happen. Those other five people who standing with you didn't piece of information to begin with. That has been like the hardest thing, well, the, I should say, told the hardest thing has been to figure out how do you give someone an understanding of technology and how it interfaces with us every day, not just how to do it, because you can't, 'cause I've been, I, I've shown people step by step how to get into their email.  But they didn't do it on their own successfully until they understood why they had to have two factor where it went to in relay. Like I had to have conversations with this, conversations like this with people because I knew this and could gather it from my experiences and from people teaching me. But if someone hasn't even had that, how do you expect them to jumpstart or to kick ahead of that?  And so like for me, I see that as like the biggest challenge is how do you. Give someone an understanding, familiarity. And not only that, but I don't even wanna say acceptance. Ownership of technology that they've never been given. They've never been told they're worthy of it, that it was theirs. It was always something that was for other people outside and for white folks that wasn't them.  Or for upper class folks, that wasn't them. Or for educated folks that wasn't there, but always folks that wasn't them. And now we realize, oh, that was a disservice. And we're trying to understand how to shortcut 15 years of absence. And I don't mean absence in a person being around, but absenting, anybody including the world giving, excuse my language, giving a fuck about them knowing anything about this.  So, and now I put, now I put on top of this, this is, this is the funny part. Now I put on top of all of that, This 65 year old gentle rehabilitated. Childlike in a lot of ways. Soul that is also stuck in their ways,  because when they find into the difficulty of just opening Gmail and it makes them cry, what hell hope do they have for website development? Right. For understanding anything else. And  that's the thing that. You, you only can provide a space for to ignite on its own. Now it's, it's a thing I, I still struggle with and it was something I realized a few years ago was like, I was afraid me, I was afraid of this damn laptop because I was worried that there was gonna be another instance where I would be looking to do something that should take me 10 or 15 minutes.  And my ignorance would sit me there for an hour and a half. And my absence from society and familiarity and being with folks in it didn't, wasn't there to let me know that this wasn't a, me being gone for 20 years problem. It was just a everyday, everyone who deals with this particular program problem.  Right. I don't, I, because I don't, because I don't have the ownership, the familiarity, I don't feel like it's mine. I don't even know when it's my fault. And so if no one's there to tell me like no. That's just what No, I'm sorry man. Like you were trying to get something outta that and that's just a, a sucky program.",64
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:10:23," I'm a statewide organizer at an organization called American Friend Service Committee or a national nonprofit, but I work in the Michigan Ypsilanti chapter, focusing right now on Second Look Legislation, trying to get that passed, get some votes in the House and Senate and get some people home.",65
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:10:35," I don't think we act, we often talk about and that is what we pour into a vacuum. And what I mean by that is, I. I take myself, for example, the, the story I just gave you. I came home, I was in prison for 20 years. I was 17 years old. I don't care how much, how fast I was with tech inside.  I don't care how many Walkman Walkmans I learned to fix or how much I could, school around on open source software on my closed in, closed in computer with no access to the internet, The fact that I would come back, had my phone for a couple weeks, maybe, And somehow now be a go-to person for my family and my community was ridiculous.  And it's like, because even though I needed, and I wa, I had holes that needed to be filled where I was going, had holes larger, you have to think about not only us, but our environment and where we're gonna be going, Like, so the idea of it becoming a lifestyle, a thing that you do sounds great when you're around people doing it.  But when you see me back to Pinehurst and school craft, man, ain't nobody checking their emails, man. No one, what I mean? Like, it, it that, that, that way of living. Right. The, the, the way the, the realization of how we can pres propel you forward is not present because the desert, it's not real for us.  There. Technology is not real for us there. why? 'cause it ain't did shit for us there. But help us get on social media and invite ourselves more. But we still got food deserts still underserved in our schools. No one's coming outta school. A, a, a tech genius. Not because you get a a a a notebook for $65.  That hasn't changed anything in the school. That $65 notebook doesn't mean that that kid's now gonna be finishing high school on time. So, like, and I, and that's obviously a, a problem too big for, for, for this approach, but it's one to be aware of because, whatever you do, that's where you're gonna be putting it at, you're gonna be putting your resources into someplace someone who has them and will.  Be great for them, but they're likely gonna go somewhere where there aren't any. So how do you keep it going? when you send that person off to the sea on a raft, how do you, what's gonna be your way to morris code to signal them at the lighthouse so they know what they're connected to. They can keep sending information where they are.  That's the problem that I keep running into. And it's like, I, I think so a friend who I'm now fortunate enough to work with is a partner who I'm working with. When she came home four years ago, or three and a half, four years ago when I first started a, because like, there's another thing too.  I started this program, I'm executive director, this nonprofit in less than two years home from a 20 year sentence. And my job is to help people who are returning home, make their way where I'm still learning it, But one, but I mean, there was no, there was no one else who was gonna do it.  There was no one doing it. Who the hell else could, what I mean? Like so I met a wonderful person, friend of mine named Lawanda. Now I'm working with her and me and Lawanda sat and cried so many nights, so many hours, so many times, so many days about just trying to understand it, trying to get the familiarity with everything from the phone to the laptop, to the interface between the two, to being able to check the Gmail on your phone through the app instead of having to log in.  And now, She's sending me Gmail, now she's sharing Google Docs with me. It took time and it took her being in the environment of folks who do it, if Lawanda hadn't have been around us, and American Friend Service Committee and all the things that she's doing to keep her in the loop. She'd have been just like the other of our friends who came home and got something going and then just found somewhere else to be, because I don't care where anybody puts on the TV screen paper, there's no spots out here like that.  No one's coming and reaching out to us in that way to where each of us feels like we've got a chance. There's some possibility for us. The fuck there is, there's a reality we see in front of us like the last 25 years. .  Like we are gonna go back out into our deserts where we sleep and live, and somehow we gotta keep that water flowing to us. So make sure the program has some way to keep us connected, to keep us in the loop. 'cause we're gonna have to loop others in. We gotta stay connected.",66

Folks on the ground who are helping, the folks who are tending to the wounded, so to speak. Right. And then you have the folks who are, in the political room or what have you, who are making sure that the laws that hurt the wounded get taken off. Like you have to have, you have to have both operating at the exact same time.  You can't forge go one for the other.

And that's not a thing that I, that, it's one thing now that I realize it's not something to expect folks who come home to do 'cause not 'cause folks out here.  Not everyone out here understands. I can't tell you how many times I was, I was talk, I remember I had a job at this is, this is a great example. I had a job at the University of Michigan as the managing editor of a literary review called The Michigan Review of Prisoner Creative Writing. . And we're trying to figure out a way to To, to keep track of all the submissions and communications when they come in.  So what will happen was, folks are writing in and they're, they're not only just using pen and paper like you would think, but they're also using scrap paper using pieces of cardboard from a box of crackers, using  any medium to transmit a written thought to that didn't get their hands on. Some of it beautiful. Some of it's sad, you think you see a person who has, these, these wasted pieces of, of departmental paper that they were able to get outta the trash and the only implement they have to write is a, is a piece of state bar soap and they're writing on paper with state soap and finding some way, some process they come up with to actually ingrain it into the fiber so that you can't just wipe.  . We were trying to figure out ways to, to keep these documents and it would get to the point to where folks would have to throw all these, all these submissions away because we, university of Michigan didn't give us enough storage space, and I couldn't, I just couldn't sit with that.  I couldn't think about all the history, all the wisdom, the knowledge, the experience, the insight that just has to be thrown away, and the fact that no one thought of a way to resolve this pissed me off. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, why don't you just take a picture of it? I'm home. Not, I'm like a a year home.  I'm like, we got phones. Take a picture. I do a, I search for 15 minutes and find Adobe Scan or capture whichever one it is. I do that. Capture, create a whole new, create a whole new thing at the job. Now we don't ever have to, we not now, we never have to get rid of anything. And we also now can expand our editorial committee because now we can have folks who can't make it to our in-person editorial committee, still see stuff on our box drive and be able to make, be able to make edits and suggestions.  So I say that to say I was at the University of Michigan at the residential college, and no one knew. Adobe scan so what that helps me realize is not to beat myself up or for us to assume well, because it's all, it's like, it's like everything else, You're gonna have folks who are gonna get it, who are gonna be with it, who are gonna catch it.  I don't know if their, their brain chemistry's gonna be the right way. They have the right upbringing and et cetera. All these facts are gonna align to where when you bring them a cell phone and sit down with them for a few hours, they're gonna catch on to it faster. And there'll be some folks who are not going to, and there'll be some folks who just won't be interested for whatever reason,  Mm-hmm. For whatever reason. And that's okay. And I would hope. This has been my experience to get wise enough to see that, okay, well that's just them. It's still worth the time and energy to allow this to be available for everybody to still pour it in. Because I'll be completely honest with you, when it comes 10, folks who have come home from 20 or 30 years of incarceration, you're trying to really show them the expansiveness that this technology can provide to them.  Man, eight of them might not really care anymore because, not because they don't care, but because so much else has happened that they can't even see that light that you're shining. It's gonna take more time for them to be able to see it. But what scares me is that, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm blowing that number up.  I don't in any way believe it's really Abe, I'm just trying to give a extreme example, but I feel like it's important for us to recognize those eight who say like, nah, I'm just not with it. I don't get it. I don't care. We still find ways to bring it to 'em. We can't leave them behind. Like I think, I think that's the point I'm trying to make is that we can't have this be a thing where we rec, where we think that only the elective few need to make it, we need to shower this shit over everybody.  what I'm saying? Where it just becomes a part of the everyday, everyday living, It's everyday living, .",68
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:19:02," It's also hard not to see every difficulty you encounter as just more proof of why you ain't shit. Why? Because if you were right, you would've went in the first place. You never would've had this problem you're facing right now. You can't escape from this seemingly logical deduction everywhere you go.  Now put in front of that is this intangible seeming thing of ones and zeros, . That I'm supposed to care enough about. That is confusing me in ways that nothing else has, like it's, it's a, it's a, it's a lot. And then to see it be integrated into so many other places, you can't escape it. You can't, you can't.  You gotta go on the SOS online to do something. every time I sat and had to walk people through that, because they, they were gone for 25 years, there was no SOS online. Now you're telling them that if they wanna do something, they have to do this first. , the larger society as a whole doesn't have that problem. They, when, when SOS online first got integrated and rolled out, they were there learning the buggy ways to get through it, they were figuring it out and, and eventually, not to say that everyone has, because I know, I know a lot of folks, my aunt right now, I'm still, I still do SOS online for her.",69
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:20:07," I was in the program called Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP). It's pretty how I came to even, it's, it was part of my trajectory to, to where I'm and, and partly responsible.  And we had this thing called PCAP Magic. So Pcap is the University of Michigan. They go inside, they perform, they run a facilitate, I should say create writing workshops, theater workshops. We got a photography workshop now at one institution, music workshops, And at the end of each semester there's a final performance.  And that is the culmination of that semester. And there's always this worry. That things won't happen. That something won't happen, that the final performance won't go off, that we won't get inside, that DOC won't allow us to get inside, that they're gonna send someone back. But one thing we found over, I think people have been around 30 years now doing this and consistently, completely deliver, dealing with the Michigan Department Corrections and the Carceral State as a whole, and every time PCAP delivers, And every time, so many other orgs I know who put together programming who try to make a change, they ass delivers because they care about delivering.  Like really, it's, it's, it sounds like, oh yeah, it sounds Disney Plus, but really like when you're starting off at that place, you want to see an objective. You want to see a better, you're going to see that like, y'all gonna make something happen. I'm not, I'm not. I don't have any doubt in it.",70
Cozine Welch, https://vimeo.com/853837255,Marker,00:21:24," They have a whole carceral state. There's a different thing called the Car ceral Research Project and like one of the things that made PCAP or makes PCAP so great is that, so there are a arts project still has these artists who they've been working with coming home and need to be out here.  And so PCAP's a community and so you get assistance from all other, from all, I got assistance with everything from. Where to go get my phone to transportation when I need to go places. Right. It was a community. But they really have always talked about technology.",71
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_mental_health_prison,00:00:00," Recently I just engaged in mental health therapy myself. And even with good insurance, I've found that it's kind of tricky post or during Covid to find carriers that will.  accept even good insurance, let alone Medicaid or let alone no insurance. In fact, our agency actually pays for some people to get mental health services because they couldn't get them any other way. So we literally come out of pocket to take care of them. This is complicated even further when you're talking about people who understand things like post-incarceration syndrome and what it is to have that kind of very specific and state sanctioned trauma.  In the mix. And there are a few people who do that, or there are a few who claim to do it and even less that actually are able to do it. But I, I think partially it's, it's because people who are formerly incarcerated are an afterthought in most things. They're an afterthought, especially when you're talking about mental health services, because I think most people either feel.  That we're beyond saving or that we wouldn't engage in services anyway. So they're not really marketed to us. They're not put out there in a way that most people would find it to be something appealing, which is one of the reasons why I've been sharing my journey very publicly so that people understand that it would be crazier.  Yes, I'm using that word on purpose to not. Engage in some kind of services after 27 years than it is to do so, and sometimes it's just good to have somebody who's a kind of a blank slate who doesn't know you, who doesn't try to fill in the blanks to, to operate as a sounding board, if nothing else, to process some of the things that we've reshaped in our memory over all the years.",72
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_tech_prison,00:01:55," I went in in 1993,  and I came ho home in 2020. January of 2020,  it also, it also threw me into the deep end of the pool when it came to technology.  I was either gonna sink or swim, so I started learning a lot of things and I found out that the undo button was my best friend. And that there weren't very many mistakes that I couldn't undo as long as I wasn't doing 'em on social media. Which I actually have a story about that too. My mom and I didn't talk for 17 years and I was peeping through the peep hole of Facebook looking at some of her stuff, and I'd started a page called Their Life Matters, and I thought I was liking something on her page with that, and it showed up as me and I didn't know how to undo a like.  So I panicked for three hours until I picked my wife up from work and she could tell me how to undo it. And it happened to be on my 50th birthday. And when I came home, my mom had said, happy birthday. And it started the, the, the, the journey to our reconciliation and So, , sometimes the worst thing you think that happens to you ends up being the best thing.  But technology is a ch a challenge for anybody. If they go away for 10 years. Technology changes so much, let alone being gone for 27. Or we had a gentleman that came in last year who did 44. He went in in 78 and came out in 2022. And so, and, and then on, on top of it, they give, , things like Obama phones and stuff like that, which are better than nothing, but they don't work the way they're supposed to.  So people learn how to operate things that don't operate the rest the way the rest of the world does. Which does . More damage than good.  , I started my reentry before I ever came home,  but I had, I had started on this path of how am I going to live my life before I got out here? So I was as prepared as you possibly could be. I mean, I hit the, the Secretary of State the day I got out because I wanted to start. The process as soon as possible. I went to the social security office the same day.  I had saved some money cuz I'd actually stopped going to school. I'd gotten my associate's degree the year before and the money that I was applying towards that, I started saving. I'm blessed with, she wasn't my wife at the time, but she's my wife now.  , Being aware of the fact that we were gonna probably need to be a two car family to, in order to really be successful. So I had a lot of things that a lot of people didn't, but part of the reason that I had them is, is because I anticipated them and I played my part in it, where people were willing to put money on my books, and buy things for me while I was incarcerated.  I would always ask them to put them off to the side. And a perfect example, that's my mother-in-law's cookie money, she called it. Every time she wanted to buy cookies, she put the money in a jar for me. And those extra two years that I stayed in in prison, that I was supposed to be out for the total of almost four years of cookie money, put $700 in my pocket when I walked out the door.  There were no programs available because everything had run. Pre-COVID a certain way and everything el everything shut down. So there really were no programs anymore. The world was scattering, trying to figure out how to do things, and I actually became more valuable to my parole officer than he was to me because I got a peer recovery coach job.  And so I started becoming aware of a lot of resources that I funneled back to him so that he could share them with other people in our situation.",73
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,change_prison_invest,00:05:32," One of the biggest things that if, as, as a taxpayer now, and I think all taxpayers should be upset with, is the fact that we don't invest. In the criminal justice sim system we spend there's a difference. And, and one of the perfect examples of that is, is the way the Department of Corrections is set up is, is it does very little to emulate the actual world that most people are gonna be released into.  It's based on, well, it's based on a military model. Where you break 'em down and then you build them back up. But when budget cuts come, it doesn't cost anything to break people down. It costs a lot to build them back up. So those are the things that always go, but even worse, it's based on a abusive parenting model.  And, and so you're talking about giving people allowances. You're talking about grounding them when they don't do what they're supposed to do. They don't really have any real budgetary lessons that are learned. They don't have any idea that the reason why they're making 17 cents an hour is because they're deferring all these other costs, and they could use all these.  Things to actually teach people before they come home, but they don't . What they do is, is that they learn that they're not worth very much, they're not worth, , good food, good clothes, any of those things. So their sense of value becomes really diminished. And I think that's the biggest challenge that we face working with the people that we do at A Brighter Way.  Getting them to understand that they're worth it. Getting them to understand that what, that we are investing in them because we believe they're gonna give something back to all of us and to society as a whole. We're not just giving them something, we're pulling something out of them that already exists.  And I think that's a huge disservice. I, a lot of people will think that it's on purpose. I don't necessarily think it's that conscious and on purpose, but I also believe that the status quo requires people to be on the bottom and people to be on the top. And therefore it allows certain people to stay on the bottom and become the aggregate for everything else.  I think that's the biggest thing is a sense of sense of purpose, a sense of value, of sense of. That they actually can be, there's stigmas and we talk about stigmas all the time, especially when we're talking about those that are imposed upon us. But the, the worst stigmas are the ones that we internalize and take with us everywhere.  So nobody has to, nobody has to do it to us because we stop ourselves. Nobody's gonna give me this job because I have a felony. Nobody's gonna do this. And I think that's one of the things that peer led reentry has the ability to kind of dispel is. Three and a half years after my incarceration, I'm the executive director of a nonprofit organization.  And so you can't tell me what you can't do. I've got nine felonies on my record. I did 27 straight. I had an a prefix that I did two years on. I've done a year and a after the county, 53 years old, and I have nearly 31 years of incarceration. So you can do these things. They just aren't easy.",74
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_returning_job,00:08:26," Nobody seems to wanna take the chance on you. I always joke that I was 30 for 30 in interviews. When I, when I came home, everybody wanted to hire me and, and gave me the thumbs up. And then, and, and, and I was not dishonest about my incarceration. I was very honest about my incarceration. But then when they actually, , did the background check, they apparently didn't hear me properly cuz then they rescinded the offer.  And it's kind of funny now because I'm, I'm the head of an organization that currently is up to about a $400,000 a year budget. And I couldn't get a job at. Blarney Castle Petroleum because I couldn't handle $50 in the till.",75
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,win_show_up,00:09:08," . I've been stubborn my entire life and I just used it in all the wrong ways. Once I came home, I used that stubbornness to my advantage and I just kept showing up.  People could decide how they wanted to interact with me, but they couldn't decide how I was gonna interact with them. That was my responsibility in that. So I just kept showing up. I kept sharing my story. I kept listening to other people because I wanna stay. A lot of people try and distance themselves from the problem, try and distance themselves themselves from their incarceration and things like that.  And I didn't want to, because I believe that I'm meant to be a voice, and so I need to stay close to these things. So, So I just kept showing up and a lot of times people would say, what are you gonna trying for that job? There's no way you're gonna get that job. It's above your pay grade.  And I said, let them tell me no because they're the only ones that can tell me no. And so I got a couple jobs that people were like, you're crazy. There's no way you're gonna get it. This job actually came to me. When the previous executive director vacated the position, I had been visible enough with work with places like Nation Outside and Home of New Vision and just volunteering and going to some of these rallies and getting to know people that the person who started this organization knew of me, thought that I was a good fit, and he called up my supervisor at Home of New Vision and he said, do you think Adam is up for this job?  My supervisor said Adam was built for this job. And 18 months later, we've quadrupled our staff, quadrupled our budgets and everybody's asking us what our secret sauce is.",76
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_education_prison,00:10:48," . One of the things is, is that the system often abuses things like that.  And so they had a bunch of people going to class and they weren't walking out with degrees. They were walking around about out with a bunch of credits and sometimes that still is the case. And then it, they have to piecemeal find a way to actually, , get close to a degree, which they have to finish when they get out.  But at least people had an opportunity, at least they had something that they were, , pouring themselves into that gave them an opportunity at a better life, , at some kind of an upward trajectory. And then I was there when they took them too. I didn't fully understand the impact of 'em until years later, and I wanted to go to college and I had to find a way to fund it.  On my own, which is very difficult. You have to find organizations that will, I mean, schools that will work with you, where the credits will be transferable, where you can actually afford them. The, the system requires you to buy brand new books every time so you can't get used books. So, , a lot of my books were.  $350 to, to do the actual class. I, I used to joke about this, but it's actually true that it's really a problem when it's easier to get ahold of pornography than it is to get ahold of textbooks. That shows how twisted the system is.  And then shortly before I came home, they started to do the second chance Pell Grants again.  So they started to do pilot programs. And it changes things. People approach things differently. I mean, if you approach your incarceration as being a prisoner, that's what you're going to become if you get to approach it by being a student. That's what you become. So you have to give people these opportunities to kind of change their life, change their family's lives in some ways, and make it so it's actually useful.  A lot of the, a lot of the stuff they give them, they like a lot of the degrees they do are entrepreneurial degrees. Those are nice in theory, except for one of your conditions of parole, is you must work for somebody else. So like many of the vocations, they're just, they're disjointed from reality.  They need to be tied to it. And if we create situations where we've got peer led reentry and things like that, people can get degrees and go into fields that they actually want to do and they're actually motivated to do. And it's not purely for money. .",77
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,win_brighter_way,00:13:12," Our organization's called A Brighter Way, and it was started by three individuals who were formally incarcerated and they realized that there had to be a better way of doing things than they were doing at the time. 2016, you were getting towards some of the end of the Zero tolerance era in, in the state of Michigan.  And so they were sending people back for everything and even ghost. Violations. And so they started working on this idea that was based on a 70 times seven mentoring model out of Muskegon, which is a little bit faith-based. And then they pulled back a little bit on that. They had a little bit of an s u d focus and they were in, in resource, rich Washtenaw County.  But they weren't really able to tap into a lot of the resources. I came into the position at a time where the resources were a little bit easier. We had some of the ARPA funding available to us, and so we've expanded on our mentoring model. We've actually gone away a little bit from mentoring to what we call navigation mentoring has this hierarchical intonation to it. And so what we're doing is, is we're helping to navigate systems that we've all previously navigated. So all the people in my office, except for one person, has been formerly incarcerated. Matter of fact, the shirt that I'm wearing that you see, the 27 on my shoulders.  It says A Brighter Way. It's got my name on the back and it's got the number of years that I served. Everybody in the office has the same thing. So we've got somebody wearing a 44, somebody wearing a 29, somebody wearing a 20. We got over a hundred years of incarceration in our office, so we do. I hate the term, but there's not a better term.  We do individualized wraparound services and I can't even explain fully what those are because until I meet the person, I can't decide what those things are. They're so individualized that it might include a cheeseburger. Cuz if I don't get a cheeseburger in you, then we can't talk about anything else.  But we do do the basic things, housing, transportation. We help connect with education. We help to connect, connect with employment, but our model is not a recidivism model. Our model is a quality of life model. Because recidivism doesn't have anything to do with the human quality of life is a very humane way of looking at this issue.",78
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,change_expand_brighter_way,00:15:27," One of the things that we want to do is, is we want to Replicate this model. We don't wanna expand. We think one of the problems is, is when organizations start to expand to being regional and when they start expanding to be statewide, when they started out local they lose a lot of what they had and they try and.  Impose one area's will and culture into another area, which doesn't always work. What we do believe is, is that our model is 75% transferable. So if we can convey that 75% to the other 83 counties around us that wanna do something very similar to a brighter way, then we can expand our reach without having to have our hands.  On all of it. So that's kind of where the capacity issue comes in is we wanna help to build capacity in the state so that there are more people using the Nation Outside Trauma-Informed, Peer-led Reentry Model. , working with people in every county, it shouldn't matter where you live. , like they say all the time, it shouldn't matter your zip code on what resources are available to you.  They should be available everywhere.",79
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_housing,00:16:38," Housing is a, they might not have it officially anymore, but redlining still exists. There's no doubt about it. There's certain areas that people can get into.  And other areas that they can't. My own experience , and, and again, I wanna preface this with the fact that I always do and I recognize the fact that I experienced these things as a white male in America, and that that does, , make a difference in a lot of areas. And still, I've had problems with housing.  I'm not on my lease right now. My wife is on the lease. We tried to move into an apartment above. My mother-in-law who's 86 years old now, wants to stay at home and my wife had already been approved. And then they said, well, we just need Adam to, , fill out the paperwork to be an occupant. And within three hours we were all now no longer approved.  And even if we came up with the money to pay six months in advance, they still wouldn't let us into the place purely because I was in prison. Because you gotta remember, I'm also executive director of a nonprofit organization.  I have nearly an 800 credit score. And so there's nothing else that goes into this except for that. And, and it was, there was like no discussions afterwards. So these things happened on a pretty regular basis. I also, it's Detroit adjacent. I also, a Brighter Way is located in Washtenaw County, which is a much more well-to-do area than Detroit.  The problem is you have Eastern Michigan and you have University of Michigan, so they've got a transient population that can always fill their housing. There's a glut of people and there's, there's a shortage. A of actual housing. So somebody who's formerly incarcerated trying to find housing in Washtenaw County is hit with two things.  The excessive price and the fact that, that if they have a that's not true. If part of Ann Arbor actually has something on the books that says they can't use your incarceration against you on the front end. On the back end, they still can. And the only thing that they have to do if they decide to do that is they have to give you your application fee back  but they still have the ability to do it. So Nation Outside is working on some stuff like that statewide to get that off the books too. But I mean, it's, it's, it's pretty regular. It's pretty regular. You expect it, especially with the bigger property owners. The only real way out of this in a lot of ways is home ownership.",80
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_home_ownership,00:19:08," And it's hard to get to home ownership if you haven't been able to get a rental history. If people aren't giving you a job. And if you're not having people that are helping to actually build your credit, and that's one of the things that, , we have some good partnerships, especially with a bank called Old National Bank, where they actually do training for our individuals.  And if they start banking there, they start working so that hopefully within two years they can get a loan, they can, they can buy their own house and go from there.",81
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,change_home_ownership,00:19:37, And then some of them we're trying to actually inspire them to buy. Multi-unit dwellings so that then we can do both things where that they can own something and they can rent to somebody else who couldn't otherwise rent.,82

But it's, but it's not even close now. But people have, if they go far enough back into the past, I tell people this all the time, the only difference between me and you is that my worst, the worst things I've ever done are documented.

And I think the thing that's been, , kind of minimized is, is the credibility that we have. They always talk about the things that could go wrong. I don't see 'em shutting prisons down. When overdose rates go up, when there are no visits, we know exactly where the, where the substances are coming in, that we don't stop hiring corrections officers.  But why is that always the answer when it comes to somebody who's been formerly incarcerated, oh, one of 'em screwed up. We can't do this anymore. It is the idea that people's racism and bigotry has to go somewhere in this society, unfortunately.  And so they can call us convicts, they can call us felons,",84
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,win_despite_system,00:21:31," The key with a lot of that is the framing that that takes place despite. The system, not because of the system, cuz it's amazing to me how they will kick us in the teeth every chance they get and then try and take credit for us.  When something goes well, it's like, you can't do both, , I did this, I did, that's the stubborn part. I did this despite you, I was not gonna become a statistic. And I, and, and I still refuse to. So I got off parole last year for the first time. It's the first time that I've been not been on parole.  Probation or some form of incarceration since 1985. And I told my parole agent when I came out, you're gonna get to count me as a victory. And he did.",85
Adam Grant, https://vimeo.com/848183882,challenge_returning_job,00:22:14," Especially when it comes to that region, it's been underserved for so long. It, it, it, it seems to be resource rich in some areas, but it's not ultimately resource rich if everybody's driving in that works there.  A lot of these positions that are, that are meant for, , reentry and people who've returned need to be given to the people who live in the area because you get. A multiplier effect out of that. So you get the time that they're actually working at their job and you get the time while they're home.  People get to see that. So I would just, I would just be aware of that, that it's not only the services that we're providing, but it's the job themselves and the upward mobility that it, that it, that it creates. That is hugely important. So this. Bullshit model of the nonprofits that it's a bunch of part-time positions because you can get three part-time positions for the cost of one full-time is garbage cuz you're forgetting the person at the front end of those services that needs to be served as well.",86

A lot of people, a lot of people will get hired and they think they're making decent money because they're getting.  , they're, they're contracting so they're getting no taxes taken out of it so that they don't understand that. They don't even have the, the, the advantage of having an employer who would pay half of those social security taxes, half of those payroll taxes. Mm-hmm. Things like that. And then they've got this huge bill.  At the end of the year, there's just so many, so many ways that people continue to be exploited, even when it doesn't appear that way.",87

It's an entry level position. So in Michigan, $40,000 in insurance and stuff like that isn't bad.  You can live on it even in Washtenaw County, barely in Washtenaw County. But you can, and we're trying to do that as opposed to, , creating three part-time positions, , for something like that because everybody who works for us is formerly incarcerated. And so we want them to have the better quality of life as well.  And then hopefully, They build up some of their skills, they go on to other areas and as I say, infiltrate other systems.

That's from the vocational village when people are coming home and whenever we see somebody coming home to our county, we reach into them.  We do it by getting to know families in the communities that have people that are incarcerated cuz they know who's coming back out to the community. So, , it's all hands on deck. We do everything that we possibly can to reach in because I always say that if I, if I meet you before you come home, especially if it's like six months before you come home, then it becomes a relationship that you have with Adam.

Where everybody understands the campus life and things like that. And then as soon as they graduate, they get told, you can't associate with any Spartans anymore.

Andy Williams Jr., https://vimeo.com/856632146,Marker,00:00:00," The challenges that I would say I'm facing is getting access to More legal advocates like counselors, legal counsel because one thing that I, I do is I'm an advocate and I use litigation that has already successfully, won.  Like if there's a a suit, a claim that's been filed that's already been won in California. Well, the same issue is going on in. Michigan, the same issue is going on in Ohio, whatever, and why we can't take that model and just duplicate it. And so what, what I have the barrier is, is saying, well, the ACLU already won in these states.  Let's copy that model over here. Same pleading, same everything. And so that access to those, attorneys that's the, the biggest barrier that I have. And the, I think I would say another barrier is the fees that are being charged to people that are incarcerated or facing incarceration. They're astronomical.  If you don't have, and I say this respectfully, but if you don't have the OJ defense money, you kind of screw it. And I say that respectfully, 'cause I'm not talking to the merits of the case. I'm just talking about being charged with murder. And you don't, you don't have access to that, that dream team.  And that is the biggest barrier. And even saying that there's a case NAACP v Button, that was probably a 1960 case . That said regular people can help other people with the law or their litigation without being charged with unauthorized practice of law if it's part of the organization's mission and goal.  And so that is beautiful for me. And then the second thing is there was a case out of New York that challenge the unauthorized practice of law to help New York New York ends whatever with debt collection and stuff and they prevailed.  And the attorney general is appealing it right now. But with those two scenarios, for me, 'cause I like, think solution oriented, I'll be filing a claim against the state of Illinois and the United States challenging the unauthorized practice of law. Because I'm a, I would consider myself a legal scholar.  I don't know if I say a legal scholar. I'm more of a, a scholar when it comes to people's rights. That's what I am. And we have a big campaign going on with our Prison Lives Matter group. 'cause that's why I'm a part of a state rep for Illinois Prison Lives Matter. But I sit on the lawful committee for the National Prison Lives Matter, and we're on a campaign to abolish legalized slavery.  What legalized slavery is, 'cause we don't really grasp that, is when 30 Democrats and 17 Republicans vote on something that infringes upon our right. So if, if you label me a felon, And the Constitution or the Second Amendment says, I have the right to bear arms and you pass legislation that says, 'cause I'm a felon, I don't have the right to bear arms.  That's legalized slavery and it's unconstitutional. Most people wouldn't see it that way because they don't know. And I am the protector of the people's rights. And so I know that's not talking about a barrier 'cause I'm really always thinking about the solution.",92
Andy Williams Jr., https://vimeo.com/856632146,Marker,00:03:13," And if we got rid of. What I consider victimless crimes, like possession of drugs or things. , it's two things. When I look about drug possession, one, you're criminalizing a status. 'cause there's people in jail for being addicts and so you're criminalizing their status.  Like, that's like somebody getting. Has a disease, cancer and then you gotta lock 'em up 'cause they got cancer. No, there's a disease. I'm, I'm in an addiction and alcoholism, you're locking people up for being drunk when they really should be going to the Betty Ford Center or which we don't have 'em in the communities.

So this is like a billion dollar industry that it's legalized slavery. That's just what it is, and we're on a campaign to abolish that.",94

It definitely was a different environment of where it is now. , when I got out of prison and finally was done with my incarceration. 'cause when I got out, I went right back after three months for selling drugs. But I beat that case in a bench trial.  I was in a period that the whole pipeline to prison wasn't so magnified as it is today. So a lot of the barriers today that are faced.  I didn't face him. And by the time, if I even would've faced him, I was already like the local poster child. the guy who arrested me on my drug case wound up becoming the chief of police. And then I sat on a board with him. I was in the church. So, like the community I think as a whole really embraced me and just how I grew up.

Andy Williams Jr., https://vimeo.com/856632146,Marker,00:05:17," I am like a, a national modern day abolitionist. I hear the stories from all over the states.  So in some states it may be, Kind of like it was in the nineties for me, but the majority of the stories I'm hearing are, are horrific. I got a text today from Indiana. They already had terrible drinking water and now they got, the toilet's been backed up since Thursday. I. And the cell is full of feces and stuff.  And like the text is like, well, who do I, who, who do I go to? Andy. And then the food that they serve . And the women's, that's a whole nother thing, just about their rights being violated. And again, I wanna know women prison, so I can't speak to that, but my sister Hollywood, who. Been out since 2017.  She can, and we had a panel yesterday and she spoke to that, the, the, the women's, the just one, the disrespect, the, the, the lack of access to tampons to write stuff. It's just horrific. And that ta takes me back to what I call legalized slavery. This is, this is, it's terrible. You keep somebody in solitary confinement for years.  What, what is this inhumane colonialism mindset? That's just, and, and I, when I, when I say that, it's because if we look at the history of United States, what was it before the United States? It was Turtle Island. So some, the back then with the Great Britain, they conquered the people. I believe that conquering mindset is still what exists that's been going on for generation to generation, and they just legitimize it by voting on it, saying We're gonna enter public safety when there's a portion of it.  I do believe in the public safety, but I also believe in a lot of the, the current system of legislation is the criminals. And then partially, I don't even think they realize that's what they're doing. 'cause you're born into it. So it's just the mindset, it's the mentality. No difference. When the person gets outta jail and is trying to get a job and it's not working, he goes back to sell drugs.  He ain't doing it 'cause he want to, he tried to do something different, but this is what works. And that's why I think, with the current legislation, police departments or whatever, what's going on as bogus. You making 70, $80,000 a year, and you're not gonna jeopardize that because you don't see another opportunity for you that exists.  So, but the prison conditions that I. I'll always go back to it. It's like modern day slavery and it's hell.",96
Andy Williams Jr., https://vimeo.com/856632146,Marker,00:07:42," legislation and enforcing the rights as a people. in 2021, the United States was found guilty for crimes against humanity, police killings, mass incarceration.  Begins to dismantle the profit margin because when the, the same thing that happened in that tribunal. With that guilty verdict is the same thing that's happening across each city. So what we're able to do is attack that  The similar, the correlation between the black codes, the slave codes, the Jim Crow, the 1994 crime bill, the gang legislation, the habitual criminal, the enhancement, like all of this is designed based on that 13th amendment being passed to where we're at today, and that guilty verdict with the tribunal.  As we begin to educate the allies, the activists, the attorneys the modern day abolitionists, I call 'em all part of the A team 'cause I'm Andy. But when we get those, and the ambassadors and bring them together and what I say is a teach in and they get educated and implement within the next, I would easily say 7 to 10 years, we would easily be able to flip the script because some of these this generation is dying off.  It's just the truth. Like you're, you're. They're not there. And if we begin to teach without thinking we need to go to Harvard, we just need to get on a webinar panel, zoom call with a pen and paper and say, this is what happened over here. This is what happened over there. This brother got off on parole because they said you could not show he was a threat to society and you've been denying him due process and infringing upon his liberty.  So now we got a whole bunch of educated people that are saying, wait, the judicial system. We hired you. You didn't, you didn't hire us, we hired you. And your role is to be a neutral arbitrator. And so when they don't do that, then we file a claim against their surety bonds and then they're no longer insured and we'll begin to see the change.  That's what I believe, and I'm optimistic, hopeful, got a lot of faith. ' cause I just believe it. I don't believe we're gonna be here like this in this position for the rest of our life and it's taken a generation. To rise up. That's not coming at it from a, a, just a physical war, but more of a spiritual, and I'm not talking about the spiritual religion.  I'm talking about the spirit of that, that was put in place many years ago and we like, that's bull crap. That that No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not doing that. And I think that's where it comes in. And the way I utilize it and, and in this, Battle we have is more of through a love concept. Like this is the love evolution, and I'm gonna, it's difficult, but I try to just give the people the benefit of the doubt and say, you don't know what you're doing.  I, I try to live it that way and take the time to educate. I've had one, some successes.  Because if you can read, which I'm, I'm an avid reader, so I, I self-taught myself through this, law stuff. So I think again, for the majority of the people, I try to say, you really don't know you're doing the job, but if you're like some of these progressive district attorneys I think it's your governor out there in California, that max it out after 15 years, see these people with a, with a different opportunity That I believe is kinda like modeled after the Norway prison.  we can, we can do it. when, when I look at Norway and what happened with North Dakota, they, they model Norway's prison and some of their guards or correctional officers, like, we not buying for this. And they quit. Bye. so these are the stories I think that could get out and people could start seeing it.  I have a sheriff in my home county,. Sheriff Ron Hane He really turned to jail into a restorative justice place like literally. I mean, brothers that was locked up with him went to his wedding, be at his house in his kitchen, like for real, like he's. he's, he's, and again, I'm not saying he's the perfect sheriff, but I'm saying it's a, it's perfect for the season we're in right now.  And I appreciate, him and I can call him up on a cell phone, like, Hey, he just, it's a different brand. He's not the only sheriff. I know there's other sheriffs around, too. So when we begin to, from a movement standpoint, as us as advocate, activists and abolitionists begin to highlight those that are being progressive and doing what is common law, what is right to treat people like people without dehumanizing them. We'll see the shift and that's why I say, within the next seven years I think we can see a, a big shift that, that that would happen. Yeah.",97
Andy Williams Jr., https://vimeo.com/856632146,Marker,00:12:08," I think if, if we, the people truly understood the difference between a republic form of government and a democracy, we would realize the republic form of government is what we're self-governing.  And I think you need the democracy in the sense when the republic form of government. Gets too big for its britches, then the majority can say, no, no, no, no, no. This is what, our rights are. So I'm not diminishing that. But you can't have a democracy think they can vote away your rights 'cause they're the majority.  We, the people are the majority. And when we say it about the, the people and, and last thing I'll say is one of the most inspiring advocates in the sixties movement was Fred Hampton Sr. Because he said, you don't fight racism with racism, you fight it with solidarity.  And he brought these young patriots that had the Dixie flag from the south to the table with the Panthers, with the young Lords and that rainbow coalition. Before Jesse Jackson was a rainbow coalition, is what I strive to see. And I know we can do that because that's what happened in 2020 social unrest with, the murder of George Floyd.  So when we take that, put it together with an educational tool and education means, I'm gonna share with you the information. You're not gonna reject it until you assess it. 'cause you just throw something out there. Ah, no. Hear it, hear it. Then I think we get to that seven year goal that I see happening.  the police officer that's pulling you over wants to go home, just like the person in the car wants to go home.

So one day one of the young men's parents came in and knew me from prison and he, you know, he spoke to me, hugged me, Hey man, man, what you doing here? And I, this is where I work at, man. They let you work in the school.  So I said, yeah, you know, I, he said, yeah, but you always was in the school getting your education, blah, blah, blah. So one of the secretaries overheard him and she was standing in the hallway. So she went back in the, and got on the computer. And when she got on the computer, apparently, cause I was on parole, she pulled up my record and she reported it to the CEO.  Now, I don't know that she done done this. So the CEO called me. Now, the principal already knew, . He say we got a red flag. So I said, well, what's the, what do you mean red flag? He said, well, it's apparent that you are an ex-offender. I said, yes. If you look at my application, it's on my application.  Then he started, well, how you get degree, what you, you was doing all this in prison and blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah. What you thought I did sit down and do nothing. I studied and went to school and worked every day. So he said, well, unfortunately, we going to have to let you go.  So the principal called me and this is what the principal said to me. He said, Mr. Muhammad, I'm not gonna say his name. He said, Mr. Muhammad, it finally appeared. He said, but because the effect that you had in this school on these young men, he said, I might let you go on paper, but you can still volunteer and I'll pay you under the table.  Not only was I effective six years, but I changed the whole paradigm of a school where they were having fights. They were doing all kind of stuff. These young brothers had so much respect for me because they understood what I came from. I knew how to communicate with them. I knew how to talk to them because I came out of the very same streets that they are in right now.

That's what I do today. TRS Transforming Reentry Service Men and Women in Prison Ministry. This is a organization and a program that I have worked with our CEO and our director for many, many, many, many years.  it is important the resource directory. And it was developed by ex-offenders. And we developed that directory so that when men and women came out of prison and they pick up that book, everything that they need to know, every resource that they need to have access to is in that, what directory they can go to the directory.  And see, oh, okay, well I can find housing here. I can find jobs here. I can find healthcare here. I can find I need drug treatment. I can find that here. I need mental health treatment. I can find that here. Everything that they need has to be in the directory because once it's in the directory and those of us that work with the prisons, once we go into the prison, then the prisoners have access to what the directory.  So that means they have access now to the resources that are available for those that are coming home and even for those that remaining under those conditions of incarceration. Cause we can't forget them either. So it serves a twofold purpose. It connects that one that's still going to be there with life plus 50, 60 years, or four or five natural life sentences and things of this nature.

Because I'm gonna tell you something, if we're not connected, if the men and women that are incarcerated are not connected to the society in which they're going to return to, then all of the organizations combined do them a disservice.  Why do they do 'em a disservice? Because they not connected to 'em. They don't know 'em. They don't have no way of knowing that you even exist",102

That's what he's suffering from. That's what she's suffering from post-traumatic prison disorder, because prison is a unnatural circumstance. There's nothing natural about it, and as a result of being in that condition for 20 and 30 years, you suffer. Some psychological damage.

Yes. So once they get out, every prison should have a what?  A pre reentry program that's preparing them anywhere from two to three years, preparing them to go home. That means connecting with the resources, getting actively involved. So we go into prison, talk to them, give them the directory, give them my, I give them my personal cell phone, emails, all of that.  They can call me. My phone constantly ringing  , if they fund us properly, see we, all of the people that work on our staff are ex-offenders. We only have two people that work with us that has not been formally incarcerated. Not only can we provide jobs for them, but we provide a platform to better serve those that are inside.  The reason that we hire ex-offenders is because ex-offenders know how to handle other ex-offenders. If you hire somebody, I don't master degree PhD college degree and they've never been there. Yeah. And they don't know how to handle this man or this woman who is suffering from a mental illness of post-traumatic prison disorder.

Now when I say nothing, nothing, you barely can get a GED.  So I spent a lot of my time in school educating myself first under my belief, and then getting the documentation that was necessary. So when I got out of prison, I knew what I would be faced with. So I spent, I spent 23 years there, almost 24 years there. I was always in school from day one.

When I came home, my mother then was, we was driving and I seen the guy, he was, he was standing in the, where the bus stop at.  I said, man, he done went crazy. He talking to himself. My mama said no, he on his Bluetooth. I said, what kind of two , his teeth is blue.  She said his Bluetooth, she said that's the device that's in his ear and he can hear and he can talk on it. So I'm like, wow. So now as I'm riding, I'm thinking about this man, they got devices but you ain't even gotta touch the phone. And that, that stayed on my mind all the time. Then when I did get a phone, I had to do the most intelligent thing in the world.  And my mom, she laughed about it. She said, what are you doing? I said, I'm reading the manual. She said, really? She said, nobody does that. I said, well, that's the only way I'm gonna learn. I gotta read the book. Cause I'm a reading book. My mother was a school teacher for 30 years. So she forced us to read as when we were growing up.  So I read the manual, that's how I learned how to write use the phone, so those are some of the challenges that we face coming home not being, see, when you don't have access to modern technology, then you like a fish out of the water.",108
Lionel Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/855112091,Marker,00:13:29," When they arrested me and locked me up, I had no idea what was going on. Took me to court, tried me. No witnesses, no evidence, no nothing. Listen to this here. When they sentence you, they say, is it anything that you want to say? And I said to the judge, these are my words. I say, if there's a God and I believe it is, you gonna pay for what you've done for to me.  Cause you know I didn't do nothing but you sending me to prison because I won't give you no money. Take him away. Seven years later, I'm in the prison. You know how they do the news story before they bring on the story?  They show the little captioning. I seen the judge. I said, man, I, I need to see what's going on. So I got in there and I listened. My judge. His name is Thomas J Maloney. They was arresting him and he went to jail. For what? Bribery. And blackmailed.  And he went to prison and he died in prison. But I'm, that's why I'm so thankful for spiritual growth and development. I'm so glad for the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan because they taught me how to overcome these conditions and not be bitter, not be angry.  Take your anger out in another way. I take my anger out by doing this work because this work is a healing for me. This how I heal every day. Cause I do the work every day.",109
Lionel Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/855112091,Marker,00:14:51," I believe that there's no human being. That cannot be redeemed. All of us can be redeemed. Mm-hmm. You know, and if we apply the principles of the scripture, both Bible and Quran, we can save 90% of our people. Cause they, they just wanna reach out.  They just want some to know somebody care. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and once somebody understands that you love them, then their response to you is different. They don't respond aggressively. They respond with love. , if you were with me, when I go in these prisons and I go in these jails and I start talking to these brothers and we have a sit down.  They appreciate me taking the time out to come there because I don't, nobody pays me to do that. Yeah. I do that from my heart because I know what it's like not to get a letter. I know what it's like to see me and go every, every day to the stand up there for the mail call and nobody calls their name.  The most valuables thing in the world to a prisoner is a letter. It ain't a visit and it ain't money. It's a letter, a piece of paper just to say, I love you and I'm thinking about you. They'll read that 50,000 times. I've seen men read one piece of paper over and over again. It didn't happen, but a few words on it.  The visit comes and goes. The money comes and goes, but the letter. They'll take those letters and put 'em in an envelope and put 'em in a box. And whenever they release, they take those letters with them. They may leave everything, books, clothes, but they take them letters with 'em. Cause those letters are very valuable to them.  ​",110
Nakia Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/844436209,challenge_returning_citizen,00:00:00," one of the, one of my largest, challenges at this time is being a return a citizen and, the reintegration aspect into society.  , you always hear, you do your time, you get an education, some skill set, a trade, et cetera, and you reintegrate yourself back into society. Well, legitimately, I'm in my third year at DeVry University working on my bachelor's for network management and communications. I have numerous.  IT certifications from the bottom. just simple basic computer use, up upgrade and repair. And the highest certification that I currently hold is the Advanced Security practitioner,I've gone and gotten education. I've applied myself and yes, I have had some, opportunities in that field. But overall, as far as me actually getting my feet firmly planted and rooted in the IT arena, it's, it is a consistent thing of you're checking all the right boxes, you're answering the questions, absolutely correctly.  But when we get to that background check aspect of things, I'm dead in the water and it's. It's disheartening, because for returning citizens and, , it's, it, it can become very disheartening for an individual who has completed their time and they're quote unquote doing the right things.  But those results from doing the right thing. Aren't readily available or they aren't, it, it, it just doesn't happen. at least not the way that it, from my perspective, the way that it's presented on your channel 2, 4, 7, yes, we have all of these great programs and, these opportunities  sound good? And, and literally, I'm, I'm one of the ones like, if not for A Chance for Life, if not for some of the other community organizations that are out there, which is, is okay. But again, it is why should I, why should I be forced to have to depend on. Some organization who may or may not be able to help me. When you said, if I go and get the education and I apply myself and I do these things, then I can reintegrate myself into society.  Well, a again, that's, it just doesn't happen like that. And, and that's a problem. And that needs to change. In some form now, how, how that change looks, because that, that actually ties into the recidivism rate. If you don't actu in actuality, give people opportunities to do and be better. When they had children.  Myself, I have three children. My oldest is 28. I have a 14, 13 year old now. Dad has to take care and provide for these children. So when it come down to, I need gym shoes, I need sports uniforms, we got a field trip, et cetera, all of that take money.  But if I'm not in a position to provide these things, and we just, that's just on school. Let's not even tie in anything else they want. I want this video game. I want to go to this concert. I want. Well, for me, at this point in I'm dead. I need to figure out how to provide these things. But if I don't have, and the IT field and cybersecurity, absolutely I should be in a much better position life-wise.  if I was in a position that would allow for that. But I'm still in the paycheck to paycheck and struggling in a completely different field that. Has nothing to do with it. I'm, working in machining right now because that was all that was available for me. and even at that, it's a struggle. things just have to change in some way, shape, form, or fashion  there's nothing I can do about what happened in 1995, the one that I know that literally like red flag, like, yeah, I can't do anything about that. I've done 11 years for that and.  Like, yeah, I was 15, 16, and. at this point in life, yes, I did what I did, but now I'm trying to do something different",111

Who may have, and, and I understand the background check is kind of important, but don't make it so heavily weighted just on background check. Don't get on TV and say, yes, we're gonna remove the check the box on your application, and.  But you still do the background check and it's, the result is still the same. You just played slight a hand, more or less switching one thing for another. Yeah, we not going to check the box, but we still gonna do this background check. So it's, it's, things need to change in that regard.",112

Cuz I've, me and other people I've, I've talked to like, why isn't there a returning citizen's union or, or something of the like, because I, I hate it that it's again, that it happens to me that I gotta take wages that are way less than what I know I'm worth and take whatever job that I can get simply because of my background. some type of union that advocates like, okay, yeah, this person might be a return that says, but you gonna pay them a wage as if you know, or give them the opportunity for working.  The same way you would give those opportunities to other individuals because it, again, debilitating being free and still feeling like you're in prison out here in society",113
Nakia Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/844436209,challenge_mental_health,00:05:47," mental health.  another of the things that. It kind of has helped me, me understanding that particularly for black men, cuz it's something we don't like, mental health issues for us is I'm crazy as opposed to this is depression, anxiety, grief, et cetera. Those things are real and you have to approach them and deal with them.  Otherwise they will negatively affect you, which led me to going and starting to talk to a therapist and, get counseling, et cetera, because I went through. Things I, I've lost key family members, my mother, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, and my late wife, like back to back. And my thing was, okay, they're dead.  There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Yes, I, I feel a loss of them, but. At those moments in time when my supervisor, you don't want to take no time off of work. Why? It's not gonna change anything and I'm just gonna sit at home and it's going to bother me even more. So I need to keep moving at this point in life.  I understand. Yeah. That grief. Needs to be addressed appropriately. Otherwise it will affect you negatively coming out later on. You can't just put, keep stuffing stuff in a box, keep stuffing it in a box and not addressing it and think that it's just gonna go away, or magically it just doesn't happen like that.  But I had to go through processes to get to this point, to understand that fact that, oh, These things are real. A lot of other individuals who may have been to prison and when it's put out there that the, these programs and things geared to help them.  The real fruition of those resources not coming through. That's another thing that adds on to, you know, why am I even trying?",114
Nakia Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/844436209,change_technology_as_tool,00:07:41," And you know, like with this whole IT thing and just bucket like, okay, mama.

So they're gonna ask you for some documents. If you don't know how to scan and attach emails and up upload these documents, then you're locking yourself outta resources that's important to you.  Here in Detroit there's many things that this computer is not just for toy.  it is not just for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat playing Candy Crush or Diner Dash and all of that is fine, but. In this community, people really understand how much of a business tool that the computer is and can be. yeah. The reality of it sinking in and people knowing how to use it as a business tool or even your smartphone is not something that's, I guess, readily available if  people don't know what they don't know and they don't know what they need to know because they don't know.",115

And again, even at that, without the finances to do that, I don't care how good my credit score is. If I can't pay the mortgage that you're gonna approve me for, then it means nothing. , if you don't have the finances to keep up with the mortgage and taxes and things like that, then it is useless with it. All of these things are kind of intertwined.",116
Nakia Muhammad, https://vimeo.com/844436209,challenge_ politics,00:09:25," there has to be changes across the board. well how does that look? Honestly, I don't know. I just know that it does, whether it's through, legislation, through company policy hiring practices, but something needs to change. The smoke and mirrors need to stop. I don't wanna sound negative. Well, It's a difference between just being negative and this is just a reality. What you, you don't wanna hear the truth. The truth is what it is. You might not like it, but hey, this is the reality of the situation that I, a lot of people, experience and, as was stated before, a lot of people just don't know how to address it or what outlets they have or what they can do about it, Legislation and things like that do need to change. And it shouldn't be an aspect of, . As a state representative, as a legislature, technically you work for me.  Okay? you don't work for the lobbyists.  people don't know that. Yeah. They don't know how politics work. They don't know. And, and fortunately, unfortunately, I've, I've been in those rooms when some of those conversations are taking place and like, wow, it sound really good here, or on the other side of it.  Election time, that whole pay to play. If you don't pay this organization or, or this lobbyist to endorse you as a candidate, then you're not elected and. With that particular candidate, an individual, all of these wonderful things that, yes, I want to lower taxes, or I wanna fix the roads, or I wanna do X, Y, or Z to garner the vote.  But then when you are elected, Those things not happening. Most average individuals returning citizen or not, like, look, you do work for me. I can fire you and get you outta your office. If people actually collectively got together and wrote, petitions and things together, et cetera, to Yeah, you not doing your job, so you gotta go.  Sorry. Mm-hmm. .

The, the resources in there, computer labs and things with, with my babies out there. Phenomenal here in the Detroit public school system, not so much. But again, it, those things that we've been talking about, the legislation and how they choose to,when they have these millages and that that data that everybody have to come to, to the school to get counted and mm-hmm.  The way that things are done and, and the distribution of resources, it, it here in Detroit night and day and, and. Something needs to be done. How, how that happens. so what can we do about it?",119
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:00:00," . Hi, my name is Angela Davenport and I provide communication support for Voting Access for All Coalition.  We are a nonprofit in Michigan that helps to ensure that people who are formerly incarcerated and justice involved know that they can vote.  Well, I will say that my own personal challenges when I came back to Michigan, I was I've experienced, I've had my own experience of being incarcerated. It was a, a limited amount of time. But when I came home, I had never been through this process. I'd never been through an arrest or. What it meant to be stripped, searched, or what it meant to be thrown in a cell.  And this was a whole new experience. So when I came back to Michigan and even just talking about it, I get really emotional. It was terrible. So I think one of the things. That I'm sure I still need, even though I have definitely put my life back together. I need like to heal mentally and emotionally.  And I think like if I went through that, I can't imagine the amount of of other people that need healing in that way too. And so I don't know that. That has been as readily accessible as it it should be. So I've been fortunate. My mom, she dropped everything to come help support me, bring me home.  But there's so many people that don't have that. I'm lucky. I'm fortunate and I know that so when I came back to Michigan, my whole focus changed. And so that's when I. Started working with people who were also justice involved to say, how could we make things better? What do we do to write to make things better for people who are reentering the community?",120
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:02:00," Because one day you're gonna get out. That's the hope, right? Is that either you're gonna stay incarcerated or you're gonna get out. It's one or the other. And so if you're gonna get out, How do we make it a easier transition? And so one of the things that I think is lacking aside from mental support is housing and and also employment.  So when I say that, I mean there are companies that we know we work with that will hire people. How do we get more companies involved in that and wanting to support, because it doesn't just help the person that's formerly incarcerated, like it will help. Make a more viable economy economic mobility for everyone in our community.  So how do we bring jobs and housing? And it seems like a very broad topic, but it's one of the things that I've been working heavily on. And so to that end, we do have something called the Michigan Fair Chance Access to Housing Act. That would help prevent some of these barriers of the background check that you have to check when you're applying for housing.",121
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:03:14," That was one of my fears was how do I ever go back to work? Who's gonna hire me?  I was thought like, oh my God, I have a master's, but that doesn't mean anything if you have this on your record, because what company is gonna take a chance on me? And so I just feel fortunate that although that happened in my life, it's brought me to where I am now. But not everybody has that.",122
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:03:40," The Michigan Fair Chance access to Housing Acts. Right now it is in the house. So it's in the legislative process. I'm working with a group called Nation Outside and who's working with Rep Aiyash he's the one that introduced the legislation and it has.  20 co-sponsors. So we're working together with the community to organize what's called Capital Day for Housing, not Hurdles is what we're calling it. This would ensure that these barriers, because so many times I can't tell you the number of times I've heard people.  Talk about living on the sofa of a friend or family member. They find housing, but then they're, once the landlord finds out that there's a criminal record involved, either they don't get it, or the other one that I see a lot is they increase the security deposit. So that's one of the big issues is that if you don't, if they find out you have a criminal record then you're either told no or you're given the options.  You, hey, you can pay double sometimes three months in advance for the security deposit. And I mean when I say I hear this, these are people that are working like steadily going to school. They are trying to better themselves and their families, and I.",123
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:05:07," Then I also hear stories because one of the things I do by providing communication support is I do interviews with people.  So, so sometimes like this, but so some of the stories I hear are that, , 10, 15 years ago, I, I had this criminal conviction, but I still can't get housing right now. So I. That is, and it's like this should not be a defacto life sentence. ? Once you've served your time, you've served it. So what, what are we really getting by continually to, to continuing to punish people.",124
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:05:45," I know that there are there are programs like in Genesee County centered around housing where they are specifically working with landlords. I don't have the specific details of that, but I know that there are programs that I would say, look up Flint. And Sheriff Chris, Chris Swanson who I know has been integral into helping people who are formerly incarcerated find safe, stable, and secure housing.",125
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:06:15," Aside from, I know housing is a big issue there's also voting. I also work with Voting Access for All Coalition VAC for short. And the main issue that we have found is that there's so many people. With a criminal record or just justice involved who think that they can't vote, they see or hear what's happening in Florida about some of the fines and fees or people voting and then later being fined or, or persecuted because of it And because of that, We found that there are people who are just hesitant to just, and they just say, what?  I don't believe in voting, so it's not even worth it to me to vote because what is, like, what's the point of voting? So, so many of our conversations, we go to churches, community events, colleges , sometimes we'll just go to community fairs and we'll walk around and just talk to people and say, Hey, are you registered to vote?  We go to expungement. Now, yes, Michigan has automatic expungement, but it's still gonna take a while for that process to be refined. So there are people who are, they're still having expungement fairs. And so when we go there, we talk to folks and we ask them if they're registered to vote. And probably three out of 10 people are not that we've experienced at these expungements.  So we register them to vote and then we. Make sure that they know to tell their friends and family. Listen, even if you're justice involved, you have a right to vote in Michigan so you, the only time you're not able to vote is if you are currently serving your sentence in Michigan. It's a huge barrier. And so that is one of the things that, that with VAC that we're actively working on and also going to coffee hours, telling people how that, , our legislators work for us. So it's so important to tell them about these issues that impact us.  Housing, employment mental health. We have to tell them and let them know that they actually work for the people. So, , so one of the things that we actively do is go out to these coffee hours, especially right now, they're on break and make sure that, , they know like the people are watching and we're holding them  accountable.",126
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:08:44," . So there is, they're what we call good time credits, right? So good time credits can reduce person's actual time in prison, right? It's called good conduct time or good credits. And so there. Laws that actually in different states where people are able to get time off their sentences by, it could be taking classes or taking certain jobs or they're.  Things that allow you, credits that allow you to get a reduction of sentence, right, so that you may get a earlier release, but with truth in sentencing, you have to serve your full sentence. You don't get a reduction in time. It's the full length of time that you've been sentenced. And so, so many people are like their families that are impacted.  By the fact that we no longer have good time credits. So right now in Michigan, there's a huge fight to reinstate good time. And I will tell you, the organization is Michigan Justice Advocacy. They are really leading the fight. For good times. So Michigan is on, is one of only six states with no policy for good time or earned time credits.  . I know that they're looking. It's House Bill 4450, sponsored by Rep Tyrone Carter.",127
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:10:16," We also have one more, which is prison gerrymandering that people may not know about, but with prison gerrymandering, you're counted even though you cannot vote while you're in prison in Michigan your body is actually counted so that reps the different areas where the prisons are, which are usually.  White and rural they are able to count you, whereas your home community where you're actually from gets none of the funding or support because it goes to the community where you are. Body is housed. And so prison gerrymandering is something that we, that at VAC we are actively fighting to end prison gerrymandering.  And it is in the legislative, it's SB 33. And so we're really fighting to see that we actually count people where they're from. Prison is not their home. Prison is no one's home.  I'm really passionate about legislation because I feel like policy and legislation is really where we can start making things better for everyone, especially people who are justice involved and people who who are impacted by what we call our legal system.",128
Angela Davenport, https://vimeo.com/851935302,Marker,00:11:31," , there's so many different organizations that are trying to do this work and trying to support people who are justice involved., one of the problems I've experienced is that, We're like in these different silos.  That one group is over here doing amazing work. Another group is over here, but we're not working on it together. And so, , our resources are limited. We're working ourselves to death and because it's hard work mentally, and, and that takes a physical taxing toll on your body. And so one of my hopes is that we'll be more that we can come together to, to do this work.  As opposed to staying on the outfield.  There is definite interconnection because if you don't have a safe place to lay your head at night, if you don't have a job to pay just to live and survive if you don't have reproductive freedom then. Why would you care about voting? Why would you care about these other issues?  So that's why they, to me, are all interconnected.",129

Like I can't ride down three blocks and it's now all of a sudden suburbanized and. It's little bitty kids that can play differently in a cleaner street and a different environment. And I feel like what happens to my little brown baby in the future, because I know as a youth growing up in Detroit, I wasn't heard.  It was like there was no protection for women and girls then, and it seemed to be no protection for women and girls now, like we just buried this baby all because her mother no longer wanted to be with a man in 2020. I had to bury my sister. Because she no longer wanted to be with her husband. It's an epidemic going on in society, and because most of the victims happen to be black and brown, it is not.  , don't get me wrong, I am forever grateful that during Covid 19, that man's life was lost, and the response to the death. I will ever be grateful for all the people, like the Black Lives Matter, everything that grew out of that one death.  It was like his name, a flood of . All these righteous, wonderful gifts",

So it's like where is the protection for the women that are incarcerated are, are there because of direct action of a man or a dominant co-defendant who was forcing things on them.  My fear is do I flee Detroit or Michigan because they don't see my baby? I. And they would never see her. Or do I stand and scream and shout and keep doing everything I feel is right, not for just myself and my daughter, but for my community. Do I still keep fighting to heal my community or do I throw in a towel and say, they're never gonna make me feel safe in Detroit because I'm not light enough.  Because I'm not the right ethnicity, you know what I'm saying? So it's like the same things can happen to the black and brown women for forever. And the first time it happens to someone of another race, then all hell loose. And that's not fair. And this is my city and it's been predominantly black most of my 53 years.  I'm sure it's been that way longer than that. So why is it that my resources, my cops, Can't come to my city block in a hurry like they do in all of the nice neighborhoods that they have now done since I've been home 2017. And when I first came home, I was devastated of my city, but now I see some improvement.  I love the idea of the walk and the bike ride to be able to go from one city all the way downtown to the river walk. I love to show off the best of my city, but there is parts and nooks and nannies of the family of the city that the mayor and everybody else don't want people to see and know about.  They need love too, and those are the spots that I care about the most. Those are the parts I do care about how my child is being educated in the Detroit public schools and their ratings. I do care about how people can want returning citizens to go show up to a Scared Straight thing to improve, prove they already feel bad, teenager or kids that's on a negative path behavior, but yet cannot allow a parent to volunteer and help.  Actually infiltrate and make sure that those children aren't making the same mistake that they made. So it's like you don't hear the little African American girl, you silence her everywhere you can. You don't try to begin to get her the help she needs and the minute she mess up, she's locked up. I fear for my daughter, I fear for her.",

Where do I have to go that I feel like my African American baby girl will be seen, will be heard, and will be validated for all of her accomplishments and not have to work 10 times as hard as the other counterparts to see the same accomplishments and achievements and get the same rewards?  Can she be safe? Can she call the cops just like somebody else can call the cops and get the same response? Do I have to move in a richer neighborhood for her to be able to get help? If somebody's breaking in just as quick as somebody else can get help in other neighborhoods, that's not fair. Why is that?  And why is my taxes higher? Why is my insurance for my car higher? Why is my road the worst? I go in outstate. I drive around in outstate cities and I be like, Ooh, no bumps, no speed bumps. We definitely not in Detroit. That bothers me. Why is only certain parts of Detroit being beautified and the parts they care about the most?  To my people That my baby may have to grow up in here. Not being invested into my taxes.

People that was maybe able to go cheat with they girlfriends or whatever they was able to do, whatever extra release they was having was taking it all out on the people that was closest to them.  And domestic violence was on an all time high and. So many people got killed during them couple of years, and it was no outcry for that. There was no like, I feel like just like we raised the roof and kicked over things and got indignant for George Floyd's death. We should have been just outright and indignant and hitting the streets for the very first wife or domestic violence victim that got killed in they home because they was trapped in there.  Because the ' cause of Covid 19, it was like you have prosecutors , yes, domestic violence is on the rise, but yet, Nothing was being done. We were on a lockdown status. These people, the worst came out of the worst of people, and I feel there was so many lives lost that shouldn't have been lost, had society cared more, but because most of the victims.  Normally be black and brown females, they don't start caring until it's in their community. Just like even the doctor who got killed by her spouse in Oakland County, she only was spoken on for a few times, and I feel like she only got as much publicity as she did is because she was from Oakland County and she had a predominant position in the they district.  So, and that's only because had she just been another African American female, she wouldn't have got that much coverage. It would've been like a one liner, one story, and that's it.  And I feel like that's not fair because hurt people, hurt people. And sometimes when you're trapped in a situation, You need avenues to get out and we don't allow victims enough space to feel safe enough to trust us as a society to be transparent enough to say, I need help. I'm not going to look you in the face and say, I'm in a domestic violence situation and I don't trust you enough to do something other than talk about me behind my back.",

If you can think it through and you got to have a clear head, and you gotta know if your thinking is thinking or if you got on the right path of thinking. And in order to do that, sometimes you need a, a. Professional to help you just be a soundboard. They don't really have to offer your opinion. 'cause most people be like, oh, I got, do people think I'm crazy if I go see a shrink or do this?  No. You crazy to keep all that crazy. Thoughts that you not even sure you understand inside of you bottled up. It's gonna blow up one way or the other and the most unexpected time whatsoever. So you might as well try to get somebody that might be able to say, I've heard of something like this. Oh, you know, it's not that uncommon then you think.  You know what I'm saying? Or somebody to be able to say, you cuckoo with cocoa puff. Yeah. You need another opinion. But I'd rather for somebody to tell me I'm crazy. Than not have the opportunity to do that. For domestic violence victims, I feel mental health would allow them to get out of that space of low self-esteem shame and all the plethora of, of negative anecdotes that comes with being in that setting.  I think it would help them build enough confidence to do the self work that they need to come up out of that. Because you can remove a victim out of a situation, but if emotionally and mentally they still there, they gonna go back. I got to mentally and then emotionally prepare myself for the, for the exile before I actually make the exile, or I'm just gonna long for home again.  Mental health should be offered to the victim as well as those who abuse people. I often feel that if my brother-in-law had got help, Real counseling that he could have seen that his way of love was not conducive to the marriage and they could have worked out him having anger issues or insecurity issues or whatever.  'cause I don't know exactly why it was he did what he did, and I'm not gonna pretend to predict it. I forgive him and I still love him and I, and it's not a day that go by that I don't wish I. That both of them was still here. And that's why I feel like mental health would have played, it would have saved my, their life.  It would've truly saved  their life. And. Even for like my family members, my loved ones, being able to seek counseling or probably save a whole lot of family. It's still a divide between the two families and it's gonna take everybody seeking.  Mental health work and working on your emotions and your mental and coming to a terms of proper grieving and it just, you, you gotta work. That's traumatic stuff you can't deal with on your own. And I think a lot of people feel like they're weak if they see their friend get killed and don't go talk to nobody.  That's not, most people don't see their friend get in front of them.",

They definitely gonna think the worst of you is you in the McDonald's line and the person behind you bumped you one too many times and you turn around and just start sticking them with your EpiPen and they end up dying.  And you wonder where did all that rage come from? Because you have so much bottle inside and you haven't talked to nobody and you haven't had an opportunity to release it because most people don't even do self care. So if you not doing mental health or self-care, you are a living, breathing, nuclear bomb waiting to go off, and you are going to destroy as many people around you when you explode that that you, you may not even want to, but you will destroy everything around you and it might just be the ones you love the most.  Do you really think some of these spouses said, I'm gonna wake up today and I'm gonna kill my spouse and kill myself. Something clicked in that moment. Something clicked and they said, this is it no more. I know for a fact when my brother-in-law killed my sister, he walked out the they was at the gas station.  I seen the video. He walked back to his car and he walked back to her car and on her and shot her. Something clicked in him. If he had intend on shooting her, he would've had the gun on him. When he was in her car, when he would've had it on him, he would've never sat in her car and talked if he was intend on killing her.  So something clicked and mental health could have stopped that clicking. Mental health could have got his mental back on track where he could have seen things in a different perspective because I'm sure he must have felt like it was the end of everything. He had to feel like, I can't go past this point and I'm not.  Okay. And we gotta get people to not go get to that point where they feel like they can't go past it. Because that's what suicides come in. That's what will people go off. And I'm just gonna have a a killing spree and I'm gonna try to make the cops kill me. ' cause they too afraid to kill they self.

          "text": " Detroit public schools get the. Bottom of the resources. I feel like, and this have a lot to do with gerrymandering, prison gerrymandering, it's like when you lock up our residents from Detroit, when you go to any prison outta all the prisons in Michigan, the higher the largest population they're gonna have is gonna be from Wayne County.  In every prison, the largest amount of population is Wayne County. So if all of our residents is populating the, the prison system, when they do, they census, they count them in, like say for instance, Genesee County, or they count them in Ionia and that money and resources go to those schools. Mm-hmm. And it takes away from Detroit Public schools.  But however, the babies of the incarcerated individuals that's are locked up in MDOC are going to those schools. So it's like you setting them up for the prison and school pipeline. Now, because the schools are shitty, they don't get as many resources as all the other schools. You don't pay the teachers as much as they need to be paid.  And you. Cram their classrooms where they can't give our students as much of attention as they might need to excel to the best of their ability. And I feel like as suburban schools, the school ratio student to teacher ratio is not as bad. And the pay is better. And also the resources that the kids receive in those other suburban schools is much better than Detroit.  And also they grade is higher. When you get the grading system, they're higher. So what can we do to make Detroit schools just as higher? Why can't we pull all these resources to pull all Michigan schools up I don't care where I stayed in Michigan. I feel like my child should get a top A grade education no matter where I live, whether it's Flint, whether it's Jackson, whether it is Lansing or Detroit.  I want the same education level and I wanted to be the top grade.  \\ I want her to have as much of a advantage as she can. Course I feel like I have a very bright young baby and I don't care. I'm now, I'm not bragging 'cause it's my baby. Mm-hmm. But I feel like she's exceptionally bright and I don't feel like she's being challenging all the ways that she can learn.  . And I feel like other school districts. Incorporate more different styles of learning and because of lack of funding, I'm dyslexic and I learn differently, and I know it takes me longer to catch up to things since other people, but I catch it, but I also, maybe somehow I have to sing it to myself or I may have to see it, you know what I'm saying?  Or somebody may have to read it, you know, or maybe hands on. It's different things that I have to learn, different techniques, so everybody is not a one way. Type learning for every subject. And I feel like because of the budget restraints, the teachers aren't allowed enough liberty to be to explore different ways of reaching their students.  And even if they did, they don't have enough capacity to do that because they're overcrowded. And that would induce extra work, especially for Detroit. So I feel, I feel like if they have more resources, they can have more teachers or they can have a bigger school or something to be able to give every student the attention that they need.  Yeah. And not say because they were a little slow, put 'em in special ed because you don't have to be in special ed just because you need to sing it to yourself to catch it.",

Well, they should tell that to people that has been in prison because I did almost 30 years and so I didn't have the advantage of growing up and like every new thing that advanced that you learned and it became like I have.  Three year olds that can do stuff better than me, and I got this wonderful job that I really enjoyed. I really love, love, love, and I'm going into that. When you tell somebody like, what's your weakness? I said, one of my biggest weaknesses was technology. Well, yet I still lost my job. Within months of being hired.  And matter of fact, weeks before Christmas I was without a job because of technology, and I had somebody actually sitting there beside me every step of the way of proving every step helping me. And it's sad because they don't think about that. It's like, It's like almost like why recidivism even exists at this point.  Because if you have somebody that's locked up for decades coming home and you don't give them no pre-training with any kind of technology, you are setting them up for failure. I'm good at what I do, but when it comes to inputting the things that I've done, I suck. It takes me longer to write a report.  For one, one-on-one that I'm having. Then it burst. I, I could have 10 one-on-ones in the time it take me to do one report for one, one-on-one, because that's how bad I suck at trying to put stuff in the computer. I'm always messing it up. After they get a new something, like I'm on my sixteenth phone since I've been home because, and it always be human error.  It never be like, maybe I've dropped a couple, two or three, but you know what I'm saying? Most of the time it was something that I did to the phone that was messed up and I had to get a replacement 'cause they couldn't fix it at the store. Like, we don't know what you did to this.",

          "text": " Returning citizen. I gave up 32 years of my life to the Michigan Department of Corrections. I returned home in 2017.  , some of the challenges I faced did after returning was  , getting a job, getting jobs. Because, people didn't wanna hire a felon. And then by me being gone for so long, they figured like it'd be hard for me to communicate with people learn different things, especially dealing with computers and things like that. I found a job, but. It wasn't a good paying job, but it paid up more or less.  , they didn't wanna hire you in, that's one of the things I didn't like about the job. Contractor and not an. Not an employee, but they want you to pay the taxes. So I found that bit very frustrating because you get, so far, that's the only, that's as far as you can get.  No one, you can't go no further and that's it. And by being a program, they don't offer you benefits or anything.  So I find that very frustrating.  , contract and work with the city, you in the program, you, you, they're not liable for you to be hurt on the job. You get hurt on the job. You have to have insurance, your own insurance. In order to help you sustain throughout your injury because like when I went on my I had to get knee replacement.  And so when I filed with them, they say, well, you supposed to have insurance to cover that. We don't cover that. And I didn't know that. And insurance that, that I did get from them was life insurance. Myself, I bought that myself, but it was life insurance. It wasn't accident, I guess you would say accidental or accident insurance.  . So that was, that's pretty rough on me now and recovering from surgery and it take a toll on you, and that,  and that plays into your it plays into your mental, because you already struggling out here, coming from where you came from and dealing with things you had to deal with in there. And then you come out here and you see a whole different world, 30 plus years. It's, it's a whole different world. And it, it is a struggle.  It gets frustrating at times. You wonder if you got what it takes to keep going, to make it. You see people, a lot of people, I get a, I get a lot of calls from some of the men that I knew in prison at two or three o'clock in the morning, and no calls don't be nothing. They don't be nice. And they be looking for a way to understand what they going through.  Is it any way that I can help 'em what they going through? But I'm going through it, but I'm, I'm getting help by helping them. So that's, that's, that's one part of it. And we didn't get that type of help that we needed. The mental, we didn't get to go see the psychiatrist and, and, and, and things like that when we were inside.  You only got to do that when you finna go home. When they finna release you, they run you through a little program. Boom, boom, and that's it. You don't get the real.  One-on-one or the classes that you need. And then when you get out here, they don't have that. So mental health is very important when dealing with prisoners that did an X amount of time because they be having problems. They have problems. And a lot of us, we've, before we went to prison, we had problems.  But we, we couldn't put a finger on it, but we couldn't nail it. We didn't understand it. But then when we got to prison, some of us was able to understand our plight. , some of us was able to get a hold on ourself, so to speak. But when, like I say, when you get back out here to this, to the real world, we like to say it's a struggle so I believe that a lot of us need to have something done in the mental health department, We need help dealing with this stuff because mental health is very, very important when dealing with ex prisoners because it's a lot of things that could, that could trigger.  A person and have a person go back to the same things that they was used to. And that'll hurt a lot of people. Hurt the community and hurt innocent people and even hurt they self as well. But you, you don't want that. You wanna be able to have a place they can go, someone they can talk to, someone where they can be assured.  That someone care for 'em, that they're looking out for, looking out for their best interest. So I believe that's important. .  I know a lot of returning citizens. I and I talked to a lot of 'em, and we all had the same, basically the same problems.  And if someone would just give us. Ear, maybe that'd be a difference of us making it or not making it so it's a struggle.",

Maybe today it'll be a better day than yesterday, but remember, we are free now, so we have to free our mind. We have to free our minds. Let's work on the mind.  I had support from my wife. My wife went and testified in front of the house in the Senate and changed the bill. From, it was a successive judge, couldn't, couldn't veto you from going in front of the board. So she, they, they, they got, that law changed and I was a recipient of, of the hundreds of people that was doing life in prison.  And they changed that. And a lot of us was, was able to go in front of the board. The board saw fit that we had served enough time and we were, our record was up to par and things like that, and they, they said, okay, we're gonna give you a chance. And so in doing that, the percentage rate of recidivism has been lower.  After that 20 years, you give that person chance and if they come back, Then they never wanted that chance.

I am the founder and executive director of S&amp;D PJ J Housing, and I'm also the outreach director for VAC Voting Access for All. And one of the challenges I faced when I first came out was housing. I couldn't rent anywhere. To save my life.  I was part of the building trades in Huron Valley, so I figured I'd have a job with Habitat for Humanity, since they use Habitat for Humanity in prison. But when I came out, I asked, I applied for the job. They said I was a felon, so I tried to apply for the housing program, may have, and they also said I couldn't get out 'cause I was a felon.  Living on your family member's couch or your friend's couch or whoever couch after a while gets harassing and you are actually homeless. And I tried to get help through different organizations. They told me I wasn't homeless. Well, that's not my address. I'm just sleeping on the couch. So I got frustrated and I went and moved into abandoned house.  That house actually used to be a house I stayed in from zero to 18. It was my grandfather's house. But in Detroit, abandoned house come with holes in the walls and everything's stolen. So the radiator, the boiler gone, holes in the floor snatching up the radiator holes in the wall, stealing the pipes. They stole the bathroom, stole the kitchen.  It was just all closets. Taking building trades inside of Huron Valley. I put my house together. So when the sun came up, I worked the sun, went down and went to sleep. I still had my aunt that didn't stay too far from me. I went to her house if I really need to sleep and take a shower. My, my neighbors was awesome.  I went knocked on anybody door, use the bathroom, get something to eat, take a break. But I'm there now. Still working on it, but it's, it is way past. It is, it's livable. It is way livable now compared to when I first moved in. Now I just have little minor makeup things I need to do.  But then I finally went into my neighborhood, they said, what you gonna do?  You done went to prison, so what? Your house been empty for over 30 years. Nobody living in there. And so I moved in 'cause I couldn't find a place to stay.  And then I found the owner, and then they they signed the deeded over to me.  I paid for it, but they signed the deeded over to me . I actually paid attention to building trades. 'cause I came from a cooking background, so being in there and I was frustrated and I was like, you know what? I might as well get something outta this and I'm not gonna be here forever. So, and with that, I used to do odd jobs to get money to put my house together.  You know, learning how to drywall, helping people frame out stuff they need. Some carpenters, there was some paint on the wall, do some demo work. Anything that had to do with housing at that time to put my house still to get a couple of dollars. I was working under the table, but it made it happen.  .  Because getting a job, job I got, got tired of saying, you know, you, you check the box, it's a wrap. You know, my name ain't felony 'cause I got a felony, you know? I mean,  shoot.  . Besides Habitat for Humanity, I went looking. I really am not a factory person.  The factory thing was not for me. I never wanted to work with none of the big three working hard, long hours for killing your body. The two and few, the two, the, the, the two and few dollars at like McDonald's and stuff, that wasn't gonna help me. Pay for rent and eat and pay my parole officer and pay DTE.  And that was another problem. The little jobs they did have, it wasn't worth going to. 'cause it's not going either. It's gonna help me pay for my parole officer and not gave me something to eat. Or I paid for something to eat, not pay for my parole officer, but it wasn't helping me with rent if I was to actually, it wasn't livable.  And the ones that are livable you, you can't have a felony. So it was just hard.",

And then I heard stories of, you know, It wasn't me, but some, you know, you violate your probation or you can't get off of parole until your supervision fees are paid off.

And so, you know, you go in and ask, can I get a application? They have your paper application. So that changed. Doing it online, no more in-person, stuff like that.

I have a CARES program right now where I meet the ladies when they get outta prison and it's a welcome home bag with soap, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrush, washcloth, towel mouthwash, all the basic needs.

If I didn't go to prison, none of this would not have came to fruition. I would've still been in somebody's kitchen cooking something, but it took me to go in there to come back out and look at the world different eyes that I didn't pay attention to voting. I voted 'cause I was told I was supposed to vote in my household and that was it.  You go vote, go vote. But I never. Really paid attention to what I'm voting for and what, what's the use for it. And working next to Nation Outside and they pushing all these policies, they busting their butt. Now we need to go vote on them for us, for us to get our rights back. We go in different neighborhoods now they say, you know, the suburbs have this, and suburbs have that.  As I got older, the suburbs voting for all of that and we not voting. So of course they gonna close everything around us and wanna know why we don't have it. Well, we not speaking up. If you don't say anything, they gonna close it. They gonna make the decision to close it. So Voting Access for All was, was, was a great, great opportunity for me to help found.  I'm one of the founders, we need to inform people coming home. They need to learn that they had the right to vote. And then, The more we tell people they had a right to vote.  'cause I'm out in the community tabling and tabling and going to different organization, going to different type of functions to let 'em know and they like, you know, I got a felony, I can't vote. I said, I got one too, but I've been voting since I got out. Just because you got it, that don't mean you can't vote.  And they was like, well my vote don't count. And this what I stick 'em with. Let's talk about stuff that happened locally. What's happening in your neighborhood? Why don't you start there voting on that. If you had a prosecutor or if you had a judge, you know, you could vote them outta the seat 'cause they didn't put you in jail.  Whatever your reason, you can vote them out and get somebody else new in. But that person that's going in, they have all these coffees and meetups and all that type of stuff. Go figure out who running for whatever and see what they're about and then see if you wanna vote for 'em.",

Teachers are required to do too much, and so I started working. I took a part-time job at Delta Airlines and I started working at Delta, and I let go of education for a while, found a new job. I was flying all over the world. I had this.  Great opportunity to experience different things. So I went away from education. Guess selfishly cuz I'm an educator at heart. But in 2018 I jumped back into education and I started educational service company that provides youth enrichment and mentoring. So my values were, you should read more, travel more, understand the habits of CEOs and develop. Tools to understand their mental health. My mother lost her mind when I was 11 years old, so I watched my mother suffer from schizophrenia from 11 till she passed when I was 27. So I kind of made myself a mental health expert watching my mother suffer. So for the years of her going back and forth to doctors getting prescribed medications, that didn't work.  And so for years I. Was right there next to her trying to figure out why my mother. And so as an adult I started to see how essential understanding of mental health was younger and younger is something that we don't talk about. As a community, when my mother was losing her mind, my mother would bust all the windows out the house, walk down the street naked.  Like I'm lucky that we didn't have a cell phone back there back then, or you would probably see my mother on some of the videos that you see on the news today. So seeing that That tragedy, that's a tragedy for a young man to see his mother in that state. You couldn't talk about it. It was nobody that I could say, Hey, I'm dealing with the worst trauma of my life over here.  So instead, I built my personality. I was able to make you laugh. I was able to talk about your truth, to hide my truth. And so ultimately what I've built now with the educational service company is an opportunity to be able to share those experiences and make sure that youth that are possibly experienced what I experienced, have out outlets and things to be able to help them to deal with the struggle of mental health in our community.  It's not just necessarily in my home, but as I've gotten older, I've. Had friends that was dealing with the exact same thing and they were like me hiding behind the mask of that trauma. So for me it is getting those resources to the youth and making sure they have access to how they can Be able to develop their toolbox and deal in these times.",

Most children, they say that are food insecure, go hungry from Friday to Sunday when school is out. So most of these children rely on.  What they get from school to feed themselves so if we have students who are hungry Friday through Sunday, and then they say the last two weekends of the month, the last third and fourth week of the month when the bridge card or the food assistant card runs out, that they're most hungry.  So if we have students who are hungry on the weekend, then when they show up to school Monday, how can we expect to hold them to any standard when. Gut health and mental health inter correlated. So learning that and seeing the, the, the effects working inside of the school. I worked in Highland Park School District.  I was at Brenda Scott seven Mile in Hoover. That's considered the red zone. So I was in these places and as you look back at some of the behavior issues we faced, I'm often compelled to wonder, was it the lack of nutrition? Were we failing nutritionally? As the basis of education. So if you don't have a healthy breakfast, how could I have been grading you and holding you accountable when you didn't have the basic tools to be successful?",

More so not how can we feed people, but how can we teach people to fish? How can we teach people to be able to harvest their food, grow their own food?  And so ultimately that's where we're over here piloting. Now we're at a farm that has 15 acres in the middle of Detroit. And the students aren't going out and seeing, alright, I have to weed today. I have to make sure this is watered. I have to harvest the vegetables. And it's ultimately showing them where their food comes from.  The sooner you're able to understand what's in your food, how to get your food, it creates a different level of confidence. As far as hunger. If you're hungry, you liable to do anything to be able to feed yourself. But when you could be able to go in the backyard, start a small garden, start a fruit tree raise some chickens, we also have eight different animals here that students are able to work around and understand the growth and life lifecycle of those things give you the confidence to be able to.  Help build themselves. So my company is rooted in how can we expose younger youth. Right now I'm working with all students. It's probably between the age of, they're all probably 14 to 17, but ideally my thought is, We've gotta start back in kindergarten, like the things that they're over here piling is ultimately the curriculum that I wanna present to schools for the kindergarten.  Bring your kindergarten children over here and let them learn how to raise chickens and collect eggs and how to plant and harvest food because food is an issue. Those numbers, knowing that in the richest country in the world, there are 3 million children in this country that. Don't have access to healthy, nutri nutritious, nutritious food.  That's terrifying. But it's, it's more of a, I think it's more of an education issue than a financial issue because we're not taught, we're no longer taught the importance of growing and being able to control your own food.",

And so I think make, making sure youth have that access to. Those jobs that are going to be essential to surviving in the future.  If you don't have access to wifi, you don't have access to The future. So with those lack of resources, there's gotta be some type of programming that we create to be able to make sure that our kids aren't getting left behind.

And then in turn, they carry and cover the nonprofit organization, urban Community Outreach, where our focus is youth hunger how can we teach the youth to understand what's in their food to better build them and be able to be.  Productive citizens in the community and in turn, impart that knowledge on those coming behind us because ultimately we're all connected, and if I'm failing, those next to me are failing.

The Youth Connection, Pingry Farms and Milton manufacturer grow Detroit Young Grow Detroit. Young talent and the Youth Connection are both resources that are very big on helping youth get.  Access to funding and the resources that youth need. So students are paid by those organizations and they're, for six weeks, they go to different work sites to work. So Pingry Farms and Milton Manufacturing agreed to host the students here. So the students come, they have garden duties, barn duties.  We have a viticulture program that's hosted by Michigan State so students can come and learn how to grow grapes and develop grapes into jelly and things like that. We have an archery program and then it's on the campus of Milton Manufacturer. Milton Manufacturing is a government fabricator that fabric fabricates government vehicles, so ultimately student, these students can go into manufacturing plant.  You can't go to college and learn how to fabricate it. Government vehicle that's here, you literally have to go in, somebody has to take you under their wing and start showing you how it's done. So ultimately it's these students can go in and develop an engineering skill that'll pay them six figures for the rest of their life without ever going to college.  And so it's right here at seven mile and 75. Most people don't even know it exists, but to me that's the opportunity to be able to. Increase more possibility. So, Pingry Farms is a farm that's 15 acres. It's 25 acres, 15 acres of it is planet. It hosts the four H program that has eight different animals.  What makes us unique is  to join four H. To raise and show animals. Ultimately, these students have to have their own farm, or you have to go out and rent an animal. But what makes Pingry unique is that the students don't have to lease their animals. So we have eight different animals for students to learn and go to county fair and show.  Ultimately, it's just A campus of opportunity. And so the students that are over here, they're, they're making impact by improving the hoop house, improving the barn, and they're improving the gardens. So we're going to continue to collect the food, donate the food, and we got three more weeks of just them being able to do something that they normally wouldn't do.  Most of these young people would be, if I spin the phone around right now, There's eight of 'em in here. You wouldn't know it was eight of 'em in here. They all on their phone. They, none of 'em, were talking to each other. So when they come here for these five hours, when they come here for these five hours, it's five hours of me barking at 'em.  Get off your phone, come on, get out here in this garden. Come on, let's go pick this food. Come on over here and go help in the barn. And so It's exciting to see them develop and come out of their, shell start talking to each other cuz they didn't know each other when they got here. They didn't know me.  And so now through our program and through this opportunity, you can see bonds forming. You can see you've taken ownership like. Each one is taking ownership in something else they like. One of the workers enjoys working with the bunnies. So he does everything retaining the bunnies.  Another one enjoys the goats, another enjoys the garden, another enjoys the hoop piles. So it's these opportunities that I'm watching for him, and it's exciting to see young people doing things that they normally wouldn't do. It's no large farms in the city of Detroit. So where else can you get access animals and this type of garden. So it is, it is, it is definitely doing what I imagined it would do. I've been executive director at Pingry Farms for a year now. July 1st, I stepped in and my focus was to increase the education. So ideally I wanted. To be able to create a space of enrichment. I didn't expect that it would be paid, that I would have students paid to be here.  It's definitely exciting for me to see.",

There were no cell phones pagers. CD players, USB cords, flash drives, none of those things were available.  A lot of my technology learning was pretty much and is pretty much on hand hands-on, I should say. And just learning that. So from that, what I've experienced is that the seniors.  People, a lot of people my age, maybe even older don't really know how to operate the new thing, the new technologies that are out there, my grandkids at four years old can operate, they can tell me stuff.

And coming home when they're like 50, 60 years old. So a lot of things that I got exposed to just from being out here in the world and having, having that opportunity to, to witness the new technologies and, and experience a lot of it myself. These individuals didn't from 13 to 40, 50, 60 years old.  They come home and they're expected to, to get just engulfed in, in what's happening in the world right now. And they don't have any, any information on, on what, what a lot of this is. Even with cars, the cars that we have now, I have a car that. You don't even put a key into it. You just push a button in.  It starts up and you don't even have a gear shift. You push a button and it shifts gears for you. Those technologies weren't around when these individuals left and left home, and now they're back and they're expected to know how to do this. Even with television.  We, a lot of 'em, we didn't have cable at one time. If we didn't have cable and internet, So we just had an antenna and, and maybe a remote control. VCRs were out with, , the tapes that you put in, we had those were available, so now we don't even use those anymore. So your television is a smart tv.

And I remember early on when he was in, you would have to put money onto onto his books so that you can make a phone call and it would, if you put $20 on onto the book for him to make a call, the, the service would take, I think, up to about $5.  Just a call. And then each call costs so much money per minute. So you're only making, if you're lucky, maybe you'll get two calls out of that $20. And a lot of these families, $20 is a lot of money. They don't have it to, to issue out like that. So, The contact with their families is, is very minimal. And then you have some of them.  I know there's one young man that was working with Silent Cry agency. He went in when he was 13. He come out, he's 50 something years old, and all of his family have passed away. So he comes home and there's no family available to him. So it's, it was hard. Hard for him to adjust and it's still hard for him to adjust to living out here in the world.  Very talented young man. Very, very gifted. He learned how to how to write papers for inmates and that kind of helped keep money coming in for him 'cause he would write letters and, and different, things that he would write for them to, to submit to courts.  And so he, he learned how to do all, all of those things. And and that's what he said, it, it kept him able to have funds to buy food and deodorant, toothpaste and stuff that a lot of us just take for granted. Here on outside and not having family available to help him out. He just found a way to survive in inside.  So now he's out and he's doing the same thing, surviving ' cause there's no skills affordable to him. And then coming out with a felony, where do you work and where do you get loans and where do you find housing and. No family. So what do you do? And what I saw with a lot of, especially the men, is they get attached to a woman that they meet that correspondence or they come up and visit and they get paroled to that female, that woman.  And while they're on probation for the few years, because they come out, even though they got out, they're still put on probation for a couple years. And if they mess up, On that probation, they go back.",

But there was some flaws in his case that the family has an attorney that's been looking at it, but even with, with our family is everybody, , trying to chip in.  It's expensive. It's still expensive. When you're talking about several thousand dollars at a time, that's gotta go for filing paperwork or for the attorney to look at the paperwork. And those are hours of of time. So it's been a few years that we did find an attorney that was willing to look at his case.  'cause he also happened to be an ex-offender who got out on a, on a technicality that happened in his case that he found. So he's using those skills. To help others that are, are locked up un unjustly or unfairly. So, but for, for families and for these young men and young women, there's a lot of women, a lot of women that have been locked up as teenagers and a lot of them, , for the crimes that they committed was, a lot of it was for self defense.  'cause of women, women get raped, they get beat, they get. Really put in bad situations to make them do things that they really don't wanna do, but it becomes a, a thing of survival for a lot of them. Or like one young, one young woman that she served 30 years in, she killed someone that was trying to rape her little sister, and I think she was, this, this lady was about 16.  So her little sister was much younger, but she got out because she was a juvenile lifer.  So it is, it's a, it's a real sad state of affairs in America.  , but a lot of these young people were released ' cause a lot of their cases were, were tried unfairly and unjustly for.  Well the young man that I was talking about, he killed his mother's boyfriend because his, he was abusive and he was only 13, but a child tried as an adult, and I think that's what the, the problem was, is that these people were were tried as, as adults and they were children. And not good representation.  You, you grow up fast, you learn how to survive. Whereas here, when you were out, you had your, your parents or your other family members that will help you maneuver through going into adulthood, , but they don't, they didn't get that.

And then you don't, they don't get back home until four or five o'clock in the evening.  Who, who? What? And their parents probably aren't there 'cause they gotta work somewhere. They gotta work one, two jobs. So the kids are home by themselves. And then of course they're gonna get into stuff. Their friends are doing things, they're gonna do stuff, there's no supervision. And then they're going to a school in a community that don't want 'em in there.  The schools, the school system, the public school systems aren't, aren't up to par like they should be. Then the kids are tired. They gotta get up if they get up and go, because after COVID, a lot of kids don't go anywhere. They, they still at home and they're behind. So what do you do? You do other things.  'cause you gotta eat, you gotta live somewhere. , mom don't have a lot of money. Grandma don't have a lot of money. Grandma don't, , she barely making it on, on $800.

They need to be willing to listen to what is really going on in their neighborhoods and in their communities. They need to really, really get more involved in, in speak out at city council meetings community, community meetings.  They should have a school in their district. They should have.

We need to. We really do need to take the blinders off and go do something. , when you sit back at home and you just peek out the window, 'cause you don't want to be involved and you don't wanna be a part of it, it doesn't solve anything.

And so coming back to a household where now you're an alpha. With, you know, maybe it's another alpha there.

I think there needs to be more services , to help the family with those, those challenges. Because what happens is it's so toxic. It's so toxic that the kids are taking away the, the argument, the the feeling of inadequacy the, the self-doubt. You thought you were ready when you got out, but you weren't equipped with everything.  You've been away for a long time. Things look different.

Recognizing who the support system is and getting it validated before they come out.  Don't tell 'em once they get out, have it already in place. Right. Already had them introduced to it like we're talking now. Virtually they can do that. They right. The, the judges talk to them virtually sometimes, right? So there, the tools are there, we just need to use them and we need, we, society needs to create this for them.  They don't know what they need. And so I like the fact that you're interviewing and asking people, I've not been incarcerated. I have I was almost, so, I think I'm scared straight, so I didn't get a chance to go. But I'm among people who are returning citizens all the time, and I'm wowed by them. I just had a class on Saturday Michigan Liberation in Detroit, and there were three facilitators, three young black facilitators, and two of them were returning citizens powerful.  They had to be in their twenties, early thirties. I'm 51 years old. Powerful. I don't even know if I was speaking like that at that age. So somewhere in that time, either they had it before they went in or they developed it, or somebody poured into them while they were locked up. I know for sure when they got out, they found a support system, something they believed in, and they poured all their time and energy into that.  A good organization or a good group to look at when people come out and they feel like they don't have a skillset is some grassroots organ organizing because there's always so much work to do, even when you find self-interest, when you find that you're interested in this or you have these problems.  So I wanna work on this for somebody else that's grassroots organizing. So I think for those people who already don't have stuff, stuff set up where they have self-doubt, We can use this time to train them. All of that money is being pumped in. That training is free, and they're among other people who believe in them.  And if we don't have them around, people who believe in them, they're gonna go back into the system.

          "text": " So I have two, so I have a 31 year old. A 28 year old and a 13 year old, and my 28 year old and my 13 year old both have individualized education plans.  Although I think my 13 year old is this just the brainiest of the three? I think he just doesn't apply himself. I think he, he has fallen victim to what this lead crisis may have been in Flint. So I think that's where some of his disconnect is because he was a kid that was walking at seven months and never crawled.  Like he had a first everything and then all of a sudden it was a big switch and there's a problem. So with him, I put him in a different category because it could have been the lead poisoning. We don't know. We won't know for years to come. But my 28 year old, he the reports I used to get on him really saved him because I came from, I came from a family where they believed in whoopings.  You know, if you didn't do something right or whatever, this is the way you were taught. I hate to say it now, but when I look back at it, it was conditioned from slavery, right? I beat on you and you don't do whatever, right? So we know that's wrong. So my son would get D's and E's, but I would tell you this, before his teachers would show me his report card, they would tell me how thoughtful, respectful.  How delightful he was to have in their class, how they would work with 20 of him every day. They would, no matter what teacher, they would big him up. And then they would show me his report card and say, well, mom, I want you to know he came in and got extra help in the morning. He, he stayed after school.  He got help. He, he ditched lunch, he got help. And so all those things helped me because I knew he gave his all, he gave his best. And another thing that came out was they said generally kids who got grades like him had behavioral problems and he didn't have any behavioral problems. Right? He was the clean cut kid.  He was a respected kid because that's how he was rear. And I worked with him just to get the D's and the E's. I knew it was a challenge 'cause I was up in the middle of the night doing those type of things. So I think too, Your background. You don't have to be a product of your environment, but those people who have already gone, gone into the jails and they weren't all bad.  Some of 'em came from affluent, , homes and, they had education, but they chose to, they chose to go down this path or they got caught, right? But, Coming back, their challenges may be something different or coming back. They might already have a job set up for them. You, we see all the time on tv it, it's on, it's on tv.  You can come from a good family and commit a crime. That family's gonna take care of you. You always have a job. It's people under you and you still doing that. Now you doing white collar crime instead of the blue collar crime and, and you know, you got an another layer there. I just think there's a lot of things that go into.  Why people are returning and the services and programs that need to happen for them. I don't know everything. You don't know everything, but they have to communicate more what their barriers are. The problem is a lot of the ones that are in there haven't used their voice. That's why they've been doing the wrong things.  They don't know how to use their voice. Is there somebody really there listening to them? Are we just trying to get 'em out, crank 'em out? Oh, they out, we know they gonna come back. It's a big business. I think that they're withholding some of the programming that they know they should have been giving these people so they could come back.  That's what I think though. That may not necessarily be true.",

Because I wear so many. But my current job I work for Michigan United. It's a grassroots organization and I'm in the movement politics department and my region is Detroit, Genessee County and Saginaw, and pretty much. What we do well, I'm in movement politics, but as an organizer slash outreach manager.  Pretty much what we do is identify injustices and we build campaigns around those injustices. So I may go to, the local grocery store or some other businesses, and I build a relationship so that they understand who we are, what we're doing in the community, because a lot of people come through their doors and they have with whatever problems they have, right? They hear a lot of things. They're, they're like the social worker, right? And they don't even know it. They're a grocery store, but they see the same people. The people that live in the neighborhood, they are yet another source of support, right?  But if they don't know how to connect the information they receive from those people with another group who's doing it. Then we, we leaving a lot of power on the table. I'm just one vessel to connect that. And grassroots. I also belong to a couple of faith-based organizations where we have an obligation to the community.  So I'm a a Eastern star, which is auxiliary to the Masons, right. And then I'm a daughter, which is the auxiliary to the Shriners, all has a Masonic foundation.  I know I meet people where they are and I think that I have an engineering background. I worked for General Motors for five, six years as an engineer, and I think those, those critical skills that I learned in college and then on the job are things that help me look at things a little different here.  In the community. Because you know that critical thinking, I always try to figure out why is that happening? I may not know why, but I see about five things that I can flag. Is there something I can do to eliminate one of those things or help to make it better? Or immerse that those five things now into three instead of the five.  I try to eliminate silos when I see people working in silos and they're overworking themselves like myself burnout, right?  And then a lot of people don't wanna use their voice 'cause it's like nobody caress, it's just me. Or you have people who are waiting for others to come save them. It's time out here in Genesee County. We can't wait for nobody to come save us. The, the factories are not coming back. We'll be waiting. If we keep waiting, we won't even have a house.  We got a lot of houses with tarps on them. So you've got people who've been incarcerated who come back to Genessee County or come back to Flint on the North end or anywhere in Flint. And the house they used to live in and grew up in, they got a tree growing up the middle of it. But they stand there, they living in the house, the lights is on, but the water is off.  This is real stuff. You just think about it. We live in Flint and I don't know where you live, but I live in Flint. We still can't use our water. So a lot of this weighs on your mental health. Right. It weighs on your mental health. I have to drive past abandoned schools and houses with tarps on them. We have food desert, and by the time I get to where I'm going I'm mentally exhausted and drained.  I'm, I'm depressed, right? So if I'm not incarcerated and I feel like that, I can only imagine how they feel when they're feel inadequate, when they come out and they don't have the support system. So I feel like when they don't have stuff set up for them and they're looking for jobs and they might be, you know, $5 away from committing a crime right to eat or whatever it is that they want, connect them to a grassroots organization.  I think they can get all of that and people will build, you know they will want to pour into their development and they can build in on their skills and we can work at something together is what I think.",

There's no way you should be going to any other neighborhood, but the first neighborhood that you set up for your people.

Nothing was given you, so you contributed to that.  Did they come back and clean up? No, they did not. Did anybody make them? No. You know what they did? They got their fancy lawyers and they let somebody else go in and buy whatever under whatever name and buy. So now it's not their responsibility to come back and clean up. They were moral responsibility to come back and clean up this water because it's their mess.  And then you leave the neighborhood and you don't fix the neighborhood. The neighborhood that you said you built for your people,  Feel like that and I'm not incarcerated, what about the people that went in when their grandparents and their parents worked for general?  There was never a poor person when General Motor was here. There was not poverty. Everybody worked. Think about that. We're a very small town.

Well, even if we have the police, the, the community doesn't want the police because the police are doing stuff like choking us out and killing us, right?  So we're like, you know what?

So I own my house and a couple other properties that, you know, make up my big lot. And so I, I'm just not gonna throw that away to leave. But other people who didn't have an was invested.  They left. But guess what? They were the same people who were raising their kids, who had the same issues, who believed there was nothing different than what they were seeing every day. Walking past these homes, these burned down schools, these houses with trees in the middle and a food desert. So they took that same, the same anger they had in them when they lived in Flint.  They took it to this rural area. And what do you think those people saw when they got there? They saw these angry people, these people who are criminals. Oh my God, we're afraid of them. They're the same people who were in the other city. So by not giving them the resources and trying to, before they go in jail, not trying to do that, what you did was create epidemic in a rural area that wasn't used to seeing that they lived off the land.  These people came from an urban area. They finna take that. All of that stuff you don't like they did in their community, they bringing it to your community. It don't stop because they changed the face of the community. It's still ingrained now. So you have to change the mindset of the people, provide them with the resources that they need.",

A really close friend about my disappointment and it relates to, to incarceration, But also just my expectancy of what the future would hold. And I was explaining to them how like, I'm really disappointed that in a lot of dystopian films or books that I read, those who are the underserved, I.  There was always those who, who seemed to have some connection to technology, They still were able to get access to enough of the parts or information or knowledge to assemble something on their own in their hobble they, they didn't have running or clean water, but they could utilize this information in some pieces and parts and create something wonderful,  and that's not what I see. In today's present, which is supposed to be a future I was supposed to look forward to, I don't see any folks who I know who are in any of these neighborhoods that I go into who are speaking in code, who are telling me about this and that. and when you do find it, it's an anomaly.  It's something you like. Oh, oh, wow. Because you recognize just like it's a food desert, it's a technology desert. Right. And not just technology, but information about technology, the understanding of it,  There's so much technology that they have and that we should have, but just not everyone has access to, This is the future we were promised in the eighties and the nineties anyway,",

          "text": " my story starts in Detroit. It takes a progressive step towards the Detroit suburb of Southfield.  Like we were three houses across the, the, the divider line we had made it. And then it transitions to prison term at 17 years old, which saw me spending 20 years incarcerated. And then there's the return for the last five years. So, I'll, I'll kind of go backwards in a way, because the return is kind of the most immediate and the things I overcame and the difficulties I face can all be traced pathologically back to the beginning,  So I'm one of those folks that was like really fortunate in that I understood technology in the ways that a lot of my, like contemporaries didn't a lot of folk when I was inside. When I was younger, I, I just always had a I don't wanna say a knack for it, but an interest. And I was fortunate enough that, when I, when I was coming up, my parents cared enough about me and my interest that they had got me like this encyclopedia set,  And so, and that would like, so now I'm getting to learn about everything and, and so when I get a, a video game system is something different to me. But I never got to, like, I, I was never like the idea of like opening stuff up and tinkering with like that was never something I had to, I. Idea. I had the idea for it, but never the ability to, because I mean, let's be honest, you gotta have resources for that.  Like if your parents went and broke they back and sweat to get you this video game system, you bet not break that thing apart. I don't care how much you think you might find out or, or where you think you might be in the future because you learned about circuitry, so, so it was one of those things where it's like, even when you have the idea, you don't necessarily have the ability to even, tinker with stuff yourself because of socioeconomic issues.  But I always had an interest. Science was always my thing. And so when I was incarcerated, I was a person that science digests and sci-fi news that was the stuff like I, that would, would be some things I would do for my own personal interest to kind of feed my own soul. And also it kept me. Abreast of what was going on.",

So I'm really, I'm like pretty good at the law because, I was trying to appeal my own case. And so just, by circumstance I became educated and the idea of helping other folks was like, yeah, you don't wanna have your knowledge and go to waste, and they were gonna pay me for it.  So it was like, win-win. And ironically enough, they were gonna pay me, which is the highest rate anyone in the MDOC can get, Like it was, it was, it was the baller status of $3 34 cents a day. When most people were getting 17 and a half cents an hour or something like that.  I was getting $3 34 in a day now. But the real boon of that was I then had access to a laptop. I had to go through a training. I had to, 'cause I had to prepare folks legal brief. I had to communicate with the law firm I  so I would prepare legal brief through the research, et cetera, et cetera, or any post-conviction remedy. And I would submit it to them for approval. They would go over it for something to be fixed. They would fix it, some new case law, whatever it may be. Because, we also did research and we got up to date case law, and then I would send it, I would give it, prepare for the person and help them mail it out, et cetera.  So that meant that every day. I was at a laptop, at a desktop, and at one point even I had a little notebook. They had something happened wrong with the desktop and they gave us these little notebooks, So I was having this daily connection and understanding with how to navigate windows and sub folders,  Graphic user interfaces, all of that. So my experience knowledge is so different right now. I didn't realize that completely until I come home. And for me it's like, I can't wait. When I first got my, when I got my first phone, maybe the first couple weeks I was home, I used to have nightmares about breaking it.  I would have literal nightmares where I would wake up thinking I had broken my phone or dropped it. Right. It was so important. It was so much the key to what was gonna make me a real human being out here. Right. I, I'm gonna be a real boy. And so it was, I was fra but I found that I had an aptitude for, or familiarity with it.",

          "text": " A lot of folks who I was coming home with didn't, and especially I and I, that I think I expected, what I didn't expect was to come home after 20 years of incarceration. The only technology I had access to was, again, a desktop. I'm, and like, I'm not even using Google Sheets or anything. I'm using Open Office,  like, we're not even using, like, so I, it's not like I'm in here doing, doing some weird stuff. And then we ended up getting some digital MP3 or MP4 players. So music listening. And they will also allow you to craft little letters through the JPay system. And you can also download photographs that your friends and family sent you.  That's the technology everyone in MDOC had access to. . And it's very much just like you would imagine on a, a player on your phone, it's, it's a few menus. . What I wasn't prepared for was that so many of folks who are already home, my friends and family and loved ones, would be so behind.  I didn't expect to come home and I become the tech guy, not even six months from being home. Yeah, yeah. Seriously. I'm the one going through the phone, connecting this, showing 'em how to do that, finding why this is doing that, recognizing that you got some malware, like, I. But that I would have to do that with people who were already out here the past two decades.  That's what really blew my mind. So when now I get a job at a place, so I ended up getting this offer to become an executive director to nonprofit called A Brighter Way. And the nonprofits focus on helping folks who are returning from home especially longer returning citizens, but anyone returning from home in Washtenaw County to to have a mentor to assist system with their transition and also to providing what's called, like we call wraparound services, That goes from anything from housing assistance to covid assistance, to job assistance, to interview assistance, to resumes, whatever. Because you can't assume that someone's coming home from incarceration and only needs a thing or two, you have to look at that whole person and their whole needs. So while doing this is when I came into real direct contact with just how far behind we are when coming home from incarceration and not just because this is the important because.  Time away from society further stagnated us. But because before we went, even went in, we were already behind. We never, we, we weren't going in with any, any, any route to latch onto. No familiarity to begin with. So now you take someone outta society who, before they left only knew of email from a television show.  It wasn't prior daily interactions or needs, and 20, 25, 30 years later, you bring them home and let them know, like, Hey, you gotta know how to do this. Not only do you have to know how to do it, you have to understand what it is, why it is, and how it works. Like you would have, had you grown through it, had you grown up with it, And the major things like the, the thing I think that troubled me the most was that it's no easy fix. we, we we're, we're forgetting that. Those of us who are familiar with this, we became so over time by ourselves, over someone guiding us over catching some piece of information on television that made sense to us because we knew, right, that commercial maybe that said something about, oh, GUI, you knew that because you knew what G U I was.  So it made something happen for your brain that it didn't happen. Those other five people who standing with you didn't piece of information to begin with. That has been like the hardest thing, well, the, I should say, told the hardest thing has been to figure out how do you give someone an understanding of technology and how it interfaces with us every day, not just how to do it, because you can't, 'cause I've been, I, I've shown people step by step how to get into their email.  But they didn't do it on their own successfully until they understood why they had to have two factor where it went to in relay. Like I had to have conversations with this, conversations like this with people because I knew this and could gather it from my experiences and from people teaching me. But if someone hasn't even had that, how do you expect them to jumpstart or to kick ahead of that?  And so like for me, I see that as like the biggest challenge is how do you. Give someone an understanding, familiarity. And not only that, but I don't even wanna say acceptance. Ownership of technology that they've never been given. They've never been told they're worthy of it, that it was theirs. It was always something that was for other people outside and for white folks that wasn't them.  Or for upper class folks, that wasn't them. Or for educated folks that wasn't there, but always folks that wasn't them. And now we realize, oh, that was a disservice. And we're trying to understand how to shortcut 15 years of absence. And I don't mean absence in a person being around, but absenting, anybody including the world giving, excuse my language, giving a fuck about them knowing anything about this.  So, and now I put, now I put on top of this, this is, this is the funny part. Now I put on top of all of that, This 65 year old gentle rehabilitated. Childlike in a lot of ways. Soul that is also stuck in their ways,  because when they find into the difficulty of just opening Gmail and it makes them cry, what hell hope do they have for website development? Right. For understanding anything else. And  that's the thing that. You, you only can provide a space for to ignite on its own. Now it's, it's a thing I, I still struggle with and it was something I realized a few years ago was like, I was afraid me, I was afraid of this damn laptop because I was worried that there was gonna be another instance where I would be looking to do something that should take me 10 or 15 minutes.  And my ignorance would sit me there for an hour and a half. And my absence from society and familiarity and being with folks in it didn't, wasn't there to let me know that this wasn't a, me being gone for 20 years problem. It was just a everyday, everyone who deals with this particular program problem.  Right. I don't, I, because I don't, because I don't have the ownership, the familiarity, I don't feel like it's mine. I don't even know when it's my fault. And so if no one's there to tell me like no. That's just what No, I'm sorry man. Like you were trying to get something outta that and that's just a, a sucky program.",

I came home, I was in prison for 20 years. I was 17 years old. I don't care how much, how fast I was with tech inside.  I don't care how many Walkman Walkmans I learned to fix or how much I could, school around on open source software on my closed in, closed in computer with no access to the internet, The fact that I would come back, had my phone for a couple weeks, maybe, And somehow now be a go-to person for my family and my community was ridiculous.  And it's like, because even though I needed, and I wa, I had holes that needed to be filled where I was going, had holes larger, you have to think about not only us, but our environment and where we're gonna be going, Like, so the idea of it becoming a lifestyle, a thing that you do sounds great when you're around people doing it.  But when you see me back to Pinehurst and school craft, man, ain't nobody checking their emails, man. No one, what I mean? Like, it, it that, that, that way of living. Right. The, the, the way the, the realization of how we can pres propel you forward is not present because the desert, it's not real for us.  There. Technology is not real for us there. why? 'cause it ain't did shit for us there. But help us get on social media and invite ourselves more. But we still got food deserts still underserved in our schools. No one's coming outta school. A, a, a tech genius. Not because you get a a a a notebook for $65.  That hasn't changed anything in the school. That $65 notebook doesn't mean that that kid's now gonna be finishing high school on time. So, like, and I, and that's obviously a, a problem too big for, for, for this approach, but it's one to be aware of because, whatever you do, that's where you're gonna be putting it at, you're gonna be putting your resources into someplace someone who has them and will.  Be great for them, but they're likely gonna go somewhere where there aren't any. So how do you keep it going? when you send that person off to the sea on a raft, how do you, what's gonna be your way to morris code to signal them at the lighthouse so they know what they're connected to. They can keep sending information where they are.  That's the problem that I keep running into. And it's like, I, I think so a friend who I'm now fortunate enough to work with is a partner who I'm working with. When she came home four years ago, or three and a half, four years ago when I first started a, because like, there's another thing too.  I started this program, I'm executive director, this nonprofit in less than two years home from a 20 year sentence. And my job is to help people who are returning home, make their way where I'm still learning it, But one, but I mean, there was no, there was no one else who was gonna do it.  There was no one doing it. Who the hell else could, what I mean? Like so I met a wonderful person, friend of mine named Lawanda. Now I'm working with her and me and Lawanda sat and cried so many nights, so many hours, so many times, so many days about just trying to understand it, trying to get the familiarity with everything from the phone to the laptop, to the interface between the two, to being able to check the Gmail on your phone through the app instead of having to log in.  And now, She's sending me Gmail, now she's sharing Google Docs with me. It took time and it took her being in the environment of folks who do it, if Lawanda hadn't have been around us, and American Friend Service Committee and all the things that she's doing to keep her in the loop. She'd have been just like the other of our friends who came home and got something going and then just found somewhere else to be, because I don't care where anybody puts on the TV screen paper, there's no spots out here like that.  No one's coming and reaching out to us in that way to where each of us feels like we've got a chance. There's some possibility for us. The fuck there is, there's a reality we see in front of us like the last 25 years. .  Like we are gonna go back out into our deserts where we sleep and live, and somehow we gotta keep that water flowing to us. So make sure the program has some way to keep us connected, to keep us in the loop. 'cause we're gonna have to loop others in. We gotta stay connected.",

And that's not a thing that I, that, it's one thing now that I realize it's not something to expect folks who come home to do 'cause not 'cause folks out here.  Not everyone out here understands. I can't tell you how many times I was, I was talk, I remember I had a job at this is, this is a great example. I had a job at the University of Michigan as the managing editor of a literary review called The Michigan Review of Prisoner Creative Writing. . And we're trying to figure out a way to To, to keep track of all the submissions and communications when they come in.  So what will happen was, folks are writing in and they're, they're not only just using pen and paper like you would think, but they're also using scrap paper using pieces of cardboard from a box of crackers, using  any medium to transmit a written thought to that didn't get their hands on. Some of it beautiful. Some of it's sad, you think you see a person who has, these, these wasted pieces of, of departmental paper that they were able to get outta the trash and the only implement they have to write is a, is a piece of state bar soap and they're writing on paper with state soap and finding some way, some process they come up with to actually ingrain it into the fiber so that you can't just wipe.  . We were trying to figure out ways to, to keep these documents and it would get to the point to where folks would have to throw all these, all these submissions away because we, university of Michigan didn't give us enough storage space, and I couldn't, I just couldn't sit with that.  I couldn't think about all the history, all the wisdom, the knowledge, the experience, the insight that just has to be thrown away, and the fact that no one thought of a way to resolve this pissed me off. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, why don't you just take a picture of it? I'm home. Not, I'm like a a year home.  I'm like, we got phones. Take a picture. I do a, I search for 15 minutes and find Adobe Scan or capture whichever one it is. I do that. Capture, create a whole new, create a whole new thing at the job. Now we don't ever have to, we not now, we never have to get rid of anything. And we also now can expand our editorial committee because now we can have folks who can't make it to our in-person editorial committee, still see stuff on our box drive and be able to make, be able to make edits and suggestions.  So I say that to say I was at the University of Michigan at the residential college, and no one knew. Adobe scan so what that helps me realize is not to beat myself up or for us to assume well, because it's all, it's like, it's like everything else, You're gonna have folks who are gonna get it, who are gonna be with it, who are gonna catch it.  I don't know if their, their brain chemistry's gonna be the right way. They have the right upbringing and et cetera. All these facts are gonna align to where when you bring them a cell phone and sit down with them for a few hours, they're gonna catch on to it faster. And there'll be some folks who are not going to, and there'll be some folks who just won't be interested for whatever reason,  Mm-hmm. For whatever reason. And that's okay. And I would hope. This has been my experience to get wise enough to see that, okay, well that's just them. It's still worth the time and energy to allow this to be available for everybody to still pour it in. Because I'll be completely honest with you, when it comes 10, folks who have come home from 20 or 30 years of incarceration, you're trying to really show them the expansiveness that this technology can provide to them.  Man, eight of them might not really care anymore because, not because they don't care, but because so much else has happened that they can't even see that light that you're shining. It's gonna take more time for them to be able to see it. But what scares me is that, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm blowing that number up.  I don't in any way believe it's really Abe, I'm just trying to give a extreme example, but I feel like it's important for us to recognize those eight who say like, nah, I'm just not with it. I don't get it. I don't care. We still find ways to bring it to 'em. We can't leave them behind. Like I think, I think that's the point I'm trying to make is that we can't have this be a thing where we rec, where we think that only the elective few need to make it, we need to shower this shit over everybody.  what I'm saying? Where it just becomes a part of the everyday, everyday living, It's everyday living, .",

And there's always this worry. That things won't happen. That something won't happen, that the final performance won't go off, that we won't get inside, that DOC won't allow us to get inside, that they're gonna send someone back. But one thing we found over, I think people have been around 30 years now doing this and consistently, completely deliver, dealing with the Michigan Department Corrections and the Carceral State as a whole, and every time PCAP delivers, And every time, so many other orgs I know who put together programming who try to make a change, they ass delivers because they care about delivering.  Like really, it's, it's, it sounds like, oh yeah, it sounds Disney Plus, but really like when you're starting off at that place, you want to see an objective.

And even with good insurance, I've found that it's kind of tricky post or during Covid to find carriers that will.  accept even good insurance, let alone Medicaid or let alone no insurance. In fact, our agency actually pays for some people to get mental health services because they couldn't get them any other way. So we literally come out of pocket to take care of them. This is complicated even further when you're talking about people who understand things like post-incarceration syndrome and what it is to have that kind of very specific and state sanctioned trauma.  In the mix. And there are a few people who do that, or there are a few who claim to do it and even less that actually are able to do it. But I, I think partially it's, it's because people who are formerly incarcerated are an afterthought in most things. They're an afterthought, especially when you're talking about mental health services, because I think most people either feel.  That we're beyond saving or that we wouldn't engage in services anyway. So they're not really marketed to us. They're not put out there in a way that most people would find it to be something appealing, which is one of the reasons why I've been sharing my journey very publicly so that people understand that it would be crazier.  Yes, I'm using that word on purpose to not. Engage in some kind of services after 27 years than it is to do so, and sometimes it's just good to have somebody who's a kind of a blank slate who doesn't know you, who doesn't try to fill in the blanks to, to operate as a sounding board, if nothing else, to process some of the things that we've reshaped in our memory over all the years.",

I was either gonna sink or swim, so I started learning a lot of things and I found out that the undo button was my best friend. And that there weren't very many mistakes that I couldn't undo as long as I wasn't doing 'em on social media. Which I actually have a story about that too. My mom and I didn't talk for 17 years and I was peeping through the peep hole of Facebook looking at some of her stuff, and I'd started a page called Their Life Matters, and I thought I was liking something on her page with that, and it showed up as me and I didn't know how to undo a like.  So I panicked for three hours until I picked my wife up from work and she could tell me how to undo it. And it happened to be on my 50th birthday. And when I came home, my mom had said, happy birthday. And it started the, the, the, the journey to our reconciliation and So, , sometimes the worst thing you think that happens to you ends up being the best thing.  But technology is a ch a challenge for anybody. If they go away for 10 years. Technology changes so much, let alone being gone for 27. Or we had a gentleman that came in last year who did 44. He went in in 78 and came out in 2022. And so, and, and then on, on top of it, they give, , things like Obama phones and stuff like that, which are better than nothing, but they don't work the way they're supposed to.  So people learn how to operate things that don't operate the rest the way the rest of the world does. Which does . More damage than good.  , I started my reentry before I ever came home,  but I had, I had started on this path of how am I going to live my life before I got out here? So I was as prepared as you possibly could be. I mean, I hit the, the Secretary of State the day I got out because I wanted to start. The process as soon as possible. I went to the social security office the same day.  I had saved some money cuz I'd actually stopped going to school. I'd gotten my associate's degree the year before and the money that I was applying towards that, I started saving. I'm blessed with, she wasn't my wife at the time, but she's my wife now.  , Being aware of the fact that we were gonna probably need to be a two car family to, in order to really be successful. So I had a lot of things that a lot of people didn't, but part of the reason that I had them is, is because I anticipated them and I played my part in it, where people were willing to put money on my books, and buy things for me while I was incarcerated.  I would always ask them to put them off to the side. And a perfect example, that's my mother-in-law's cookie money, she called it. Every time she wanted to buy cookies, she put the money in a jar for me. And those extra two years that I stayed in in prison, that I was supposed to be out for the total of almost four years of cookie money, put $700 in my pocket when I walked out the door.  There were no programs available because everything had run. Pre-COVID a certain way and everything el everything shut down. So there really were no programs anymore. The world was scattering, trying to figure out how to do things, and I actually became more valuable to my parole officer than he was to me because I got a peer recovery coach job.  And so I started becoming aware of a lot of resources that I funneled back to him so that he could share them with other people in our situation.",

In the criminal justice sim system we spend there's a difference. And, and one of the perfect examples of that is, is the way the Department of Corrections is set up is, is it does very little to emulate the actual world that most people are gonna be released into.  It's based on, well, it's based on a military model. Where you break 'em down and then you build them back up. But when budget cuts come, it doesn't cost anything to break people down. It costs a lot to build them back up. So those are the things that always go, but even worse, it's based on a abusive parenting model.  And, and so you're talking about giving people allowances. You're talking about grounding them when they don't do what they're supposed to do. They don't really have any real budgetary lessons that are learned. They don't have any idea that the reason why they're making 17 cents an hour is because they're deferring all these other costs, and they could use all these.  Things to actually teach people before they come home, but they don't . What they do is, is that they learn that they're not worth very much, they're not worth, , good food, good clothes, any of those things. So their sense of value becomes really diminished. And I think that's the biggest challenge that we face working with the people that we do at A Brighter Way.  Getting them to understand that they're worth it. Getting them to understand that what, that we are investing in them because we believe they're gonna give something back to all of us and to society as a whole. We're not just giving them something, we're pulling something out of them that already exists.  And I think that's a huge disservice. I, a lot of people will think that it's on purpose. I don't necessarily think it's that conscious and on purpose, but I also believe that the status quo requires people to be on the bottom and people to be on the top. And therefore it allows certain people to stay on the bottom and become the aggregate for everything else.  I think that's the biggest thing is a sense of sense of purpose, a sense of value, of sense of. That they actually can be, there's stigmas and we talk about stigmas all the time, especially when we're talking about those that are imposed upon us. But the, the worst stigmas are the ones that we internalize and take with us everywhere.  So nobody has to, nobody has to do it to us because we stop ourselves. Nobody's gonna give me this job because I have a felony. Nobody's gonna do this. And I think that's one of the things that peer led reentry has the ability to kind of dispel is. Three and a half years after my incarceration, I'm the executive director of a nonprofit organization.  And so you can't tell me what you can't do. I've got nine felonies on my record. I did 27 straight. I had an a prefix that I did two years on. I've done a year and a after the county, 53 years old, and I have nearly 31 years of incarceration. So you can do these things. They just aren't easy.",

They were walking around about out with a bunch of credits and sometimes that still is the case. And then it, they have to piecemeal find a way to actually, , get close to a degree, which they have to finish when they get out.  But at least people had an opportunity, at least they had something that they were, , pouring themselves into that gave them an opportunity at a better life, , at some kind of an upward trajectory. And then I was there when they took them too. I didn't fully understand the impact of 'em until years later, and I wanted to go to college and I had to find a way to fund it.  On my own, which is very difficult. You have to find organizations that will, I mean, schools that will work with you, where the credits will be transferable, where you can actually afford them. The, the system requires you to buy brand new books every time so you can't get used books. So, , a lot of my books were.  $350 to, to do the actual class. I, I used to joke about this, but it's actually true that it's really a problem when it's easier to get ahold of pornography than it is to get ahold of textbooks. That shows how twisted the system is.  And then shortly before I came home, they started to do the second chance Pell Grants again.  So they started to do pilot programs. And it changes things. People approach things differently. I mean, if you approach your incarceration as being a prisoner, that's what you're going to become if you get to approach it by being a student. That's what you become. So you have to give people these opportunities to kind of change their life, change their family's lives in some ways, and make it so it's actually useful.  A lot of the, a lot of the stuff they give them, they like a lot of the degrees they do are entrepreneurial degrees. Those are nice in theory, except for one of your conditions of parole, is you must work for somebody else. So like many of the vocations, they're just, they're disjointed from reality.  They need to be tied to it. And if we create situations where we've got peer led reentry and things like that, people can get degrees and go into fields that they actually want to do and they're actually motivated to do.

And so they were sending people back for everything and even ghost. Violations. And so they started working on this idea that was based on a 70 times seven mentoring model out of Muskegon, which is a little bit faith-based. And then they pulled back a little bit on that. They had a little bit of an s u d focus and they were in, in resource, rich Washtenaw County.  But they weren't really able to tap into a lot of the resources. I came into the position at a time where the resources were a little bit easier. We had some of the ARPA funding available to us, and so we've expanded on our mentoring model. We've actually gone away a little bit from mentoring to what we call navigation mentoring has this hierarchical intonation to it. And so what we're doing is, is we're helping to navigate systems that we've all previously navigated. So all the people in my office, except for one person, has been formerly incarcerated. Matter of fact, the shirt that I'm wearing that you see, the 27 on my shoulders.  It says A Brighter Way. It's got my name on the back and it's got the number of years that I served. Everybody in the office has the same thing. So we've got somebody wearing a 44, somebody wearing a 29, somebody wearing a 20. We got over a hundred years of incarceration in our office, so we do. I hate the term, but there's not a better term.  We do individualized wraparound services and I can't even explain fully what those are because until I meet the person, I can't decide what those things are. They're so individualized that it might include a cheeseburger. Cuz if I don't get a cheeseburger in you, then we can't talk about anything else.  But we do do the basic things, housing, transportation. We help connect with education. We help to connect, connect with employment, but our model is not a recidivism model.

My mother-in-law who's 86 years old now, wants to stay at home and my wife had already been approved. And then they said, well, we just need Adam to, , fill out the paperwork to be an occupant. And within three hours we were all now no longer approved.  And even if we came up with the money to pay six months in advance, they still wouldn't let us into the place purely because I was in prison. Because you gotta remember, I'm also executive director of a nonprofit organization.  I have nearly an 800 credit score. And so there's nothing else that goes into this except for that. And, and it was, there was like no discussions afterwards. So these things happened on a pretty regular basis. I also, it's Detroit adjacent. I also, a Brighter Way is located in Washtenaw County, which is a much more well-to-do area than Detroit.  The problem is you have Eastern Michigan and you have University of Michigan, so they've got a transient population that can always fill their housing. There's a glut of people and there's, there's a shortage. A of actual housing. So somebody who's formerly incarcerated trying to find housing in Washtenaw County is hit with two things.  The excessive price and the fact that, that if they have a that's not true. If part of Ann Arbor actually has something on the books that says they can't use your incarceration against you on the front end. On the back end, they still can. And the only thing that they have to do if they decide to do that is they have to give you your application fee back  but they still have the ability to do it. So Nation Outside is working on some stuff like that statewide to get that off the books too. But I mean, it's, it's, it's pretty regular. It's pretty regular.

Like if there's a a suit, a claim that's been filed that's already been won in California. Well, the same issue is going on in. Michigan, the same issue is going on in Ohio, whatever, and why we can't take that model and just duplicate it. And so what, what I have the barrier is, is saying, well, the ACLU already won in these states.  Let's copy that model over here. Same pleading, same everything. And so that access to those, attorneys that's the, the biggest barrier that I have. And the, I think I would say another barrier is the fees that are being charged to people that are incarcerated or facing incarceration. They're astronomical.  If you don't have, and I say this respectfully, but if you don't have the OJ defense money, you kind of screw it. And I say that respectfully, 'cause I'm not talking to the merits of the case. I'm just talking about being charged with murder. And you don't, you don't have access to that, that dream team.  And that is the biggest barrier. And even saying that there's a case NAACP v Button, that was probably a 1960 case . That said regular people can help other people with the law or their litigation without being charged with unauthorized practice of law if it's part of the organization's mission and goal.  And so that is beautiful for me. And then the second thing is there was a case out of New York that challenge the unauthorized practice of law to help New York New York ends whatever with debt collection and stuff and they prevailed.  And the attorney general is appealing it right now. But with those two scenarios, for me, 'cause I like, think solution oriented, I'll be filing a claim against the state of Illinois and the United States challenging the unauthorized practice of law. Because I'm a, I would consider myself a legal scholar.  I don't know if I say a legal scholar. I'm more of a, a scholar when it comes to people's rights. That's what I am. And we have a big campaign going on with our Prison Lives Matter group. 'cause that's why I'm a part of a state rep for Illinois Prison Lives Matter. But I sit on the lawful committee for the National Prison Lives Matter, and we're on a campaign to abolish legalized slavery.  What legalized slavery is, 'cause we don't really grasp that, is when 30 Democrats and 17 Republicans vote on something that infringes upon our right. So if, if you label me a felon, And the Constitution or the Second Amendment says, I have the right to bear arms and you pass legislation that says, 'cause I'm a felon, I don't have the right to bear arms.  That's legalized slavery and it's unconstitutional. Most people wouldn't see it that way because they don't know. And I am the protector of the people's rights. And so I know that's not talking about a barrier 'cause I'm really always thinking about the solution.",

They already had terrible drinking water and now they got, the toilet's been backed up since Thursday. I. And the cell is full of feces and stuff.  And like the text is like, well, who do I, who, who do I go to? Andy. And then the food that they serve . And the women's, that's a whole nother thing, just about their rights being violated. And again, I wanna know women prison, so I can't speak to that, but my sister Hollywood, who. Been out since 2017.  She can, and we had a panel yesterday and she spoke to that, the, the, the women's, the just one, the disrespect, the, the, the lack of access to tampons to write stuff. It's just horrific. And that ta takes me back to what I call legalized slavery. This is, this is, it's terrible. You keep somebody in solitary confinement for years.  What, what is this inhumane colonialism mindset? That's just, and, and I, when I, when I say that, it's because if we look at the history of United States, what was it before the United States? It was Turtle Island. So some, the back then with the Great Britain, they conquered the people. I believe that conquering mindset is still what exists that's been going on for generation to generation, and they just legitimize it by voting on it, saying We're gonna enter public safety when there's a portion of it.  I do believe in the public safety, but I also believe in a lot of the, the current system of legislation is the criminals. And then partially, I don't even think they realize that's what they're doing. 'cause you're born into it. So it's just the mindset, it's the mentality. No difference. When the person gets outta jail and is trying to get a job and it's not working, he goes back to sell drugs.  He ain't doing it 'cause he want to, he tried to do something different, but this is what works. And that's why I think, with the current legislation, police departments or whatever, what's going on as bogus. You making 70, $80,000 a year, and you're not gonna jeopardize that because you don't see another opportunity for you that exists.  So, but the prison conditions that I. I'll always go back to it.

Begins to dismantle the profit margin because when the, the same thing that happened in that tribunal. With that guilty verdict is the same thing that's happening across each city. So what we're able to do is attack that  The similar, the correlation between the black codes, the slave codes, the Jim Crow, the 1994 crime bill, the gang legislation, the habitual criminal, the enhancement, like all of this is designed based on that 13th amendment being passed to where we're at today, and that guilty verdict with the tribunal.  As we begin to educate the allies, the activists, the attorneys the modern day abolitionists, I call 'em all part of the A team 'cause I'm Andy. But when we get those, and the ambassadors and bring them together and what I say is a teach in and they get educated and implement within the next, I would easily say 7 to 10 years, we would easily be able to flip the script because some of these this generation is dying off.  It's just the truth. Like you're, you're. They're not there. And if we begin to teach without thinking we need to go to Harvard, we just need to get on a webinar panel, zoom call with a pen and paper and say, this is what happened over here. This is what happened over there. This brother got off on parole because they said you could not show he was a threat to society and you've been denying him due process and infringing upon his liberty.  So now we got a whole bunch of educated people that are saying, wait, the judicial system. We hired you. You didn't, you didn't hire us, we hired you. And your role is to be a neutral arbitrator. And so when they don't do that, then we file a claim against their surety bonds and then they're no longer insured and we'll begin to see the change.  That's what I believe, and I'm optimistic, hopeful, got a lot of faith. ' cause I just believe it. I don't believe we're gonna be here like this in this position for the rest of our life and it's taken a generation. To rise up. That's not coming at it from a, a, just a physical war, but more of a spiritual, and I'm not talking about the spiritual religion.  I'm talking about the spirit of that, that was put in place many years ago and we like, that's bull crap. That that No, no, no, no, no, no. We're not doing that. And I think that's where it comes in. And the way I utilize it and, and in this, Battle we have is more of through a love concept. Like this is the love evolution, and I'm gonna, it's difficult, but I try to just give the people the benefit of the doubt and say, you don't know what you're doing.  I, I try to live it that way and take the time to educate. I've had one, some successes.  Because if you can read, which I'm, I'm an avid reader, so I, I self-taught myself through this, law stuff. So I think again, for the majority of the people, I try to say, you really don't know you're doing the job, but if you're like some of these progressive district attorneys I think it's your governor out there in California, that max it out after 15 years, see these people with a, with a different opportunity That I believe is kinda like modeled after the Norway prison.  we can, we can do it. when, when I look at Norway and what happened with North Dakota, they, they model Norway's prison and some of their guards or correctional officers, like, we not buying for this. And they quit. Bye. so these are the stories I think that could get out and people could start seeing it.  I have a sheriff in my home county,. Sheriff Ron Hane He really turned to jail into a restorative justice place like literally. I mean, brothers that was locked up with him went to his wedding, be at his house in his kitchen, like for real, like he's. he's, he's, and again, I'm not saying he's the perfect sheriff, but I'm saying it's a, it's perfect for the season we're in right now.  And I appreciate, him and I can call him up on a cell phone, like, Hey, he just, it's a different brand. He's not the only sheriff. I know there's other sheriffs around, too. So when we begin to, from a movement standpoint, as us as advocate, activists and abolitionists begin to highlight those that are being progressive and doing what is common law, what is right to treat people like people without dehumanizing them. We'll see the shift and that's why I say, within the next seven years I think we can see a, a big shift that, that that would happen. Yeah.",

We're still paying for the crimes that we allegedly committed. So even though they say you serve your time and you, you, you now supposed to be regaining your citizenship, but every time you fill out an application and they see that you are an ex-offender, they say, well, we don't hire ex-offenders.. Because we live in a society that capitalize on the ignorance of others. So they tell us, well, it is a criminal. This, this person has done this wrong and that person has done this wrong and, and they need to be locked away forever. But if somebody has done wrong and you call yourself a Christian society, then whether there's forgiveness come in at  I was already building the prison ministry. I've been doing this for years. I did it inside a prison and I'm doing it outside, but I worked for a school, I worked for Urban Prep Academy, which is an all black school, an all male black school.  And I worked there for six years as a counselor. I have a master's degree in communication. So one day one of the young men's parents came in and knew me from prison and he, you know, he spoke to me, hugged me, Hey man, man, what you doing here? And I, this is where I work at, man. They let you work in the school.  So I said, yeah, you know, I, he said, yeah, but you always was in the school getting your education, blah, blah, blah. So one of the secretaries overheard him and she was standing in the hallway. So she went back in the, and got on the computer. And when she got on the computer, apparently, cause I was on parole, she pulled up my record and she reported it to the CEO.  Now, I don't know that she done done this. So the CEO called me. Now, the principal already knew, . He say we got a red flag. So I said, well, what's the, what do you mean red flag? He said, well, it's apparent that you are an ex-offender. I said, yes. If you look at my application, it's on my application.  Then he started, well, how you get degree, what you, you was doing all this in prison and blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah. What you thought I did sit down and do nothing. I studied and went to school and worked every day. So he said, well, unfortunately, we going to have to let you go.  So the principal called me and this is what the principal said to me. He said, Mr. Muhammad, I'm not gonna say his name. He said, Mr. Muhammad, it finally appeared. He said, but because the effect that you had in this school on these young men, he said, I might let you go on paper, but you can still volunteer and I'll pay you under the table.  Not only was I effective six years, but I changed the whole paradigm of a school where they were having fights. They were doing all kind of stuff. These young brothers had so much respect for me because they understood what I came from. I knew how to communicate with them. I knew how to talk to them because I came out of the very same streets that they are in right now.  So if you came out of where they came from, you are more successful in reaching them as opposed to hollering and screaming at 'em.",

This is a organization and a program that I have worked with our CEO and our director for many, many, many, many years.  it is important the resource directory. And it was developed by ex-offenders. And we developed that directory so that when men and women came out of prison and they pick up that book, everything that they need to know, every resource that they need to have access to is in that, what directory they can go to the directory.  And see, oh, okay, well I can find housing here. I can find jobs here. I can find healthcare here. I can find I need drug treatment. I can find that here. I need mental health treatment. I can find that here. Everything that they need has to be in the directory because once it's in the directory and those of us that work with the prisons, once we go into the prison, then the prisoners have access to what the directory.  So that means they have access now to the resources that are available for those that are coming home and even for those that remaining under those conditions of incarceration. Cause we can't forget them either. So it serves a twofold purpose. It connects that one that's still going to be there with life plus 50, 60 years, or four or five natural life sentences and things of this nature.  That person can help others while they're incarcerated",

I stayed in school, got my master's degree, my bachelor's degree, my associate's arts degree in political science, because it's important for you to be educated, but it's also important for you to be able to understand yourself.

I told a guy this morning on the phone, don't just sit there and count the calendar, everything that they have to offer. Get it cause it's free, don't cost you nothing. So make them pay how you make them pay. Get educated.  Sure. They gonna laugh at you. Oh man, that old man.

When I got locked up, that wasn't even around. We have to learn to use these devices and I'm gonna tell you, something funny.

My mama said no, he on his Bluetooth. I said, what kind of two , his teeth is blue.  She said his Bluetooth, she said that's the device that's in his ear and he can hear and he can talk on it.

She said, nobody does that. I said, well, that's the only way I'm gonna learn. I gotta read the book. Cause I'm a reading book. My mother was a school teacher for 30 years.

Well, legitimately, I'm in my third year at DeVry University working on my bachelor's for network management and communications. I have numerous.  IT certifications from the bottom. just simple basic computer use, up upgrade and repair. And the highest certification that I currently hold is the Advanced Security practitioner,I've gone and gotten education. I've applied myself and yes, I have had some, opportunities in that field. But overall, as far as me actually getting my feet firmly planted and rooted in the IT arena, it's, it is a consistent thing of you're checking all the right boxes, you're answering the questions, absolutely correctly.  But when we get to that background check aspect of things, I'm dead in the water and it's. It's disheartening, because for returning citizens and, , it's, it, it can become very disheartening for an individual who has completed their time and they're quote unquote doing the right things.  But those results from doing the right thing. Aren't readily available or they aren't, it, it, it just doesn't happen. at least not the way that it, from my perspective, the way that it's presented on your channel 2, 4, 7, yes, we have all of these great programs and, these opportunities  sound good? And, and literally, I'm, I'm one of the ones like, if not for A Chance for Life, if not for some of the other community organizations that are out there, which is, is okay. But again, it is why should I, why should I be forced to have to depend on. Some organization who may or may not be able to help me. When you said, if I go and get the education and I apply myself and I do these things, then I can reintegrate myself into society.  Well, a again, that's, it just doesn't happen like that. And, and that's a problem. And that needs to change. In some form now, how, how that change looks, because that, that actually ties into the recidivism rate. If you don't actu in actuality, give people opportunities to do and be better. When they had children.  Myself, I have three children. My oldest is 28. I have a 14, 13 year old now. Dad has to take care and provide for these children. So when it come down to, I need gym shoes, I need sports uniforms, we got a field trip, et cetera, all of that take money.  But if I'm not in a position to provide these things, and we just, that's just on school. Let's not even tie in anything else they want. I want this video game. I want to go to this concert. I want. Well, for me, at this point in I'm dead. I need to figure out how to provide these things. But if I don't have, and the IT field and cybersecurity, absolutely I should be in a much better position life-wise.  if I was in a position that would allow for that. But I'm still in the paycheck to paycheck and struggling in a completely different field that. Has nothing to do with it. I'm, working in machining right now because that was all that was available for me. and even at that, it's a struggle. things just have to change in some way, shape, form, or fashion  there's nothing I can do about what happened in 1995, the one that I know that literally like red flag, like, yeah, I can't do anything about that. I've done 11 years for that and.  Like, yeah, I was 15, 16, and. at this point in life, yes, I did what I did, but now I'm trying to do something different",

Otherwise they will negatively affect you, which led me to going and starting to talk to a therapist and, get counseling, et cetera, because I went through. Things I, I've lost key family members, my mother, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, and my late wife, like back to back. And my thing was, okay, they're dead.  There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Yes, I, I feel a loss of them, but. At those moments in time when my supervisor, you don't want to take no time off of work. Why? It's not gonna change anything and I'm just gonna sit at home and it's going to bother me even more. So I need to keep moving at this point in life.  I understand. Yeah. That grief. Needs to be addressed appropriately. Otherwise it will affect you negatively coming out later on. You can't just put, keep stuffing stuff in a box, keep stuffing it in a box and not addressing it and think that it's just gonna go away, or magically it just doesn't happen like that.  But I had to go through processes to get to this point, to understand that fact that, oh, These things are real. A lot of other individuals who may have been to prison and when it's put out there that the, these programs and things geared to help them.  The real fruition of those resources not coming through. That's another thing that adds on to, you know, why am I even trying?",

We are a nonprofit in Michigan that helps to ensure that people who are formerly incarcerated and justice involved know that they can vote.  Well, I will say that my own personal challenges when I came back to Michigan, I was I've experienced, I've had my own experience of being incarcerated. It was a, a limited amount of time. But when I came home, I had never been through this process. I'd never been through an arrest or. What it meant to be stripped, searched, or what it meant to be thrown in a cell.  And this was a whole new experience. So when I came back to Michigan and even just talking about it, I get really emotional. It was terrible. So I think one of the things. That I'm sure I still need, even though I have definitely put my life back together. I need like to heal mentally and emotionally.  And I think like if I went through that, I can't imagine the amount of of other people that need healing in that way too. And so I don't know that. That has been as readily accessible as it it should be. So I've been fortunate. My mom, she dropped everything to come help support me, bring me home.  But there's so many people that don't have that. I'm lucky. I'm fortunate and I know that so when I came back to Michigan, my whole focus changed. And so that's when I. Started working with people who were also justice involved to say, how could we make things better? What do we do to write to make things better for people who are reentering the community?",

And so if you're gonna get out, How do we make it a easier transition? And so one of the things that I think is lacking aside from mental support is housing and and also employment.  So when I say that, I mean there are companies that we know we work with that will hire people. How do we get more companies involved in that and wanting to support, because it doesn't just help the person that's formerly incarcerated, like it will help. Make a more viable economy economic mobility for everyone in our community.  So how do we bring jobs and housing? And it seems like a very broad topic, but it's one of the things that I've been working heavily on. And so to that end, we do have something called the Michigan Fair Chance Access to Housing Act. That would help prevent some of these barriers of the background check that you have to check when you're applying for housing.",

This would ensure that these barriers, because so many times I can't tell you the number of times I've heard people.  Talk about living on the sofa of a friend or family member. They find housing, but then they're, once the landlord finds out that there's a criminal record involved, either they don't get it, or the other one that I see a lot is they increase the security deposit. So that's one of the big issues is that if you don't, if they find out you have a criminal record then you're either told no or you're given the options.

And the main issue that we have found is that there's so many people. With a criminal record or just justice involved who think that they can't vote, they see or hear what's happening in Florida about some of the fines and fees or people voting and then later being fined or, or persecuted because of it And because of that, We found that there are people who are just hesitant to just, and they just say, what?  I don't believe in voting, so it's not even worth it to me to vote because what is, like, what's the point of voting? So, so many of our conversations, we go to churches, community events, colleges , sometimes we'll just go to community fairs and we'll walk around and just talk to people and say, Hey, are you registered to vote?  We go to expungement. Now, yes, Michigan has automatic expungement, but it's still gonna take a while for that process to be refined. So there are people who are, they're still having expungement fairs. And so when we go there, we talk to folks and we ask them if they're registered to vote. And probably three out of 10 people are not that we've experienced at these expungements.  So we register them to vote and then we. Make sure that they know to tell their friends and family. Listen, even if you're justice involved, you have a right to vote in Michigan so you, the only time you're not able to vote is if you are currently serving your sentence in Michigan. It's a huge barrier. And so that is one of the things that, that with VAC that we're actively working on and also going to coffee hours, telling people how that, , our legislators work for us. So it's so important to tell them about these issues that impact us.  Housing, employment mental health. We have to tell them and let them know that they actually work for the people. So, , so one of the things that we actively do is go out to these coffee hours, especially right now, they're on break and make sure that, , they know like the people are watching and we're holding them  accountable.",

Things that allow you, credits that allow you to get a reduction of sentence, right, so that you may get a earlier release, but with truth in sentencing, you have to serve your full sentence. You don't get a reduction in time. It's the full length of time that you've been sentenced. And so, so many people are like their families that are impacted.  By the fact that we no longer have good time credits. So right now in Michigan, there's a huge fight to reinstate good time. And I will tell you, the organization is Michigan Justice Advocacy. They are really leading the fight. For good times. So Michigan is on, is one of only six states with no policy for good time or earned time credits.  . I know that they're looking.

White and rural they are able to count you, whereas your home community where you're actually from gets none of the funding or support because it goes to the community where you are. Body is housed. And so prison gerrymandering is something that we, that at VAC we are actively fighting to end prison gerrymandering.  And it is in the legislative, it's SB 33. And so we're really fighting to see that we actually count people where they're from. Prison is not their home. Prison is no one's home.

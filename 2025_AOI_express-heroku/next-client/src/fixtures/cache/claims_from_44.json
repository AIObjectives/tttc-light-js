One thing that I'm seeing, and maybe they don't know how to communicate it is that when they, when they come back trying to merge with a family after they've been removed for so long, and especially the men, the men are coming back, the men are supposed to be the head of the household, right? And so coming back to a household where now you're an alpha. With, you know, maybe it's another alpha there. Maybe the child has now become that person that has been helping mom try to hold the family together. So there's a struggle. Right? And it's a struggle. And I don't think that they understand why the struggle exists.",

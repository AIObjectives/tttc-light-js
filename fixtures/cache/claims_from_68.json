I had a job at the University of Michigan as the managing editor of a literary review called The Michigan Review of Prisoner Creative Writing. . And we're trying to figure out a way to To, to keep track of all the submissions and communications when they come in.  So what will happen was, folks are writing in and they're, they're not only just using pen and paper like you would think, but they're also using scrap paper using pieces of cardboard from a box of crackers, using  any medium to transmit a written thought to that didn't get their hands on. Some of it beautiful. Some of it's sad, you think you see a person who has, these, these wasted pieces of, of departmental paper that they were able to get outta the trash and the only implement they have to write is a, is a piece of state bar soap and they're writing on paper with state soap and finding some way, some process they come up with to actually ingrain it into the fiber so that you can't just wipe.  . We were trying to figure out ways to, to keep these documents and it would get to the point to where folks would have to throw all these, all these submissions away because we, university of Michigan didn't give us enough storage space, and I couldn't, I just couldn't sit with that.  I couldn't think about all the history, all the wisdom, the knowledge, the experience, the insight that just has to be thrown away, and the fact that no one thought of a way to resolve this pissed me off. I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, why don't you just take a picture of it? I'm home. Not, I'm like a a year home.  I'm like, we got phones. Take a picture. I do a, I search for 15 minutes and find Adobe Scan or capture whichever one it is. I do that. Capture, create a whole new, create a whole new thing at the job. Now we don't ever have to, we not now, we never have to get rid of anything. And we also now can expand our editorial committee because now we can have folks who can't make it to our in-person editorial committee, still see stuff on our box drive and be able to make, be able to make edits and suggestions.  So I say that to say I was at the University of Michigan at the residential college, and no one knew. Adobe scan",

But what scares me is that, and I'm, I'm, I'm blowing that number up.  I don't in any way believe it's really Abe, I'm just trying to give an extreme example, but I feel like it's important for us to recognize those eight who say like, nah, I'm just not with it. I don't get it. I don't care. We still find ways to bring it to 'em. We can't leave them behind. Like I think, I think that's the point I'm trying to make is that we can't have this be a thing where we rec, where we think that only the elective few need to make it, we need to shower this stuff over everybody.",

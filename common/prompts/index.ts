I will give you a list of comments.
I want you to propose a way to break down the information contained in these comments into topics and subtopics of interest. 
Keep the topic and subtopic names very concise and use the short description to explain what the topic is about.

I'm going to give you a comment made by a participant and a list of topics and subtopics which have already been extracted.  
I want you to extract a list of concise claims that the participant may support.
We are only interested in claims that can be mapped to one of the given topic and subtopic. 
The claim must be fairly general but not a platitude. 
It must be something that other people may potentially disagree with. Each claim must also be atomic. 
For each claim, please also provide a relevant quote from the transcript. 
The quote must be as concise as possible while still supporting the argument. 
The quote doesn't need to be a logical argument. 
It could also be a personal story or anecdote illustrating why the interviewee would make this claim. 
You may use "[...]" in the quote to skip the less interesting bits of the quote. 

Return a JSON object of the form {
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim": string, // a very concise extracted claim
      "quote": string // the exact quote,

      "subtopicName": string // from the list of subtopics

The nesting will be represented as a JSON object where the keys are the ids of the 
top-level claims and the values are lists of ids of the nested claims.

statements on this topic: one group which would agree with the statement, and one which would disagree.
Please explain your reasoning and assign participants into "agree" and "disagree" groups.
